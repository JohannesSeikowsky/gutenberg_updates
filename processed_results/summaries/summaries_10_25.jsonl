{"76688": "\"Fundamentals of fiction writing\" by Arthur Sullivant Hoffman is a guidebook on writing fiction written in the early 20th century. It centers on how to craft stories that genuinely grip readers by creating and preserving an absorbing illusion. Emphasizing clarity, simplicity, and individuality over rigid technique, it offers practical, market-aware advice on plot, character, style, and audience.  The opening of the book lays out the author\u2019s purpose, credentials, and method: an editor\u2019s-eye view that treats the reader as a core part of the art process. He argues that modern teaching overvalues technique and imitation, and that real success comes from simplicity, clearness, and maintaining the story\u2019s illusion. He distinguishes straight fiction from fiction-as-vehicle (philosophy, instruction, sermon), warns how easily illusion is broken, and shares an illustrative writer\u2019s letter rejecting formulaic \u201cFord-like\u201d stories. He then proposes three audience strategies (ignore, target, or broaden) and urges writers to study real human reactions. Practical chapters catalog common breakers of illusion\u2014unfamiliar words, foreign phrases, showy allusions, odd names, dialect, authorial intrusions, inconsistencies\u2014and explain how to ensure clarity in names, dialogue, and scene logic. He also cautions against overstrain, advocating brevity, varied sentence length, relief scenes, and simpler plots (with special notes on frames and mystery stories), before moving into a discussion of convincingness.

Along the way he collides with the guarded Diane and a violent ex-con, Simeon Bent, as law, loyalty, and survival intertwine in the snowbound North.  The opening of the novel begins with a radio broadcast to an RCMP outpost that Kitchener Tearl overhears in New York, stirring old family wounds: a grandfather who served the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company, a father\u2013Inspector Bill Tearl\u2013who vanished twelve years earlier, and a fugitive brother, Jerry. Kit rushes north through Port-o\u2019-Prayer, hires dogs, and falls in with a wary, scarred traveler who calls himself Jim; a night-time glimpse at the man\u2019s ivory-handled revolver reveals it once belonged to Kit\u2019s father. Reunited in the woods with Jerry\u2014now Sergeant Buck\u2014Kit learns of a gold-laden sledge, a murdered woman at Great Owl Run, and the likely guilt of Simeon Bent, while Jerry hints at a distant Inuit band led by a white man who wears a police badge.

{"76691": "\"Goethe and Schiller''s Xenions by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller\" is a collection of satirical epigrams written in the late 18th century. Cast in classical elegiac distichs, the work blends literary polemic with philosophical reflection, targeting critics and cultural trends while defending a higher ideal of art and thought. The likely topic is a sharp, witty defense of reason, taste, and moral seriousness against philistinism, sentimentality, and shallow rationalism, framed as brief, pointed couplets.  The book begins with an account of the Xenions\u2019 origin and their classical form, then presents the poems in themed groups. \u201cIntroductory\u201d declares the poets\u2019 purpose; \u201cSoul and World\u201d distills ideas on reason, nature, fate, and immortality; \u201cCritical and Literary\u201d assails dull reviewers and hollow trends; \u201cSatirical and Personal\u201d lampoons named figures like Nicolai and the Stolbergs; \u201cThe Philosophers in Hades\u201d stages a brisk underworld colloquy with Descartes, Spinoza, Berkeley, Leibniz, Kant, Hume, Fichte, and others; \u201cPhilosophical Problems\u201d weighs empiricism, system-building, teleology, and duty; \u201cScience and Art\u201d contrasts genius and imitation, poetry and natural science, and celebrates bold discovery through the figure of Columbus; and \u201cWisdom, Morality and Religion\u201d offers compact maxims on virtue, truth versus error, ritual, mysticism, and the unity behind change.

{"76692": "\"Hunger\" by Knut Hamsun is a novel written in the late 19th century. It is a stark, psychologically intimate portrait of a destitute young writer wandering Christiania, tracing his pride, imagination, and desperation as hunger frays his mind. The focus is less on plot than on a vivid inner life\u2014restless thoughts, sudden exaltations, and humiliations\u2014rendered in intense, impressionistic prose.  The opening of the novel follows an unnamed aspiring writer as he wakes in a bare attic, broke and hungry, and drifts through Christiania trying to write, find work, and keep his dignity. He pawns his waistcoat to give a coin to a lame stranger, buys a meager meal, and oscillates between grand ideas (new essays and \u201cphilosophical\u201d treatises) and erratic impulses (taunting a woman he dubs Ylajali, spinning lies for a credulous old man). He submits a literary sketch to a newspaper and clings to hope while dodging his landlady, then abandons his room and spends a cold, miserable night in the woods. Hunger sharpens and distorts his perceptions; small slights enrage him, and brief bursts of inspiration give way to emptiness. By the end of this opening, rebuffed for a bookkeeping job over a foolish date error, he is weakened and ashamed, yet still forcing a polite front as he tries to seize any chance\u2014such as an advertised job helping an invalid\u2014that might keep him going.

It focuses on practical care of skin and hair, explains scientific treatments and their limits, and cautions readers about cosmetic fads and beauty quackery, while also offering a handful of general health pointers.  The book opens by showing how modern medicine treats skin disease\u2014with X-rays, radium, ultraviolet light, surgery, and drugs\u2014while noting conditions that resist cure. It demystifies cosmetics (there is no \u201cskin food\u201d), advises electric needle as the only reliable method for removing superfluous hair, and details hazards from hair dyes and dyed furs, especially paraphenylene-diamine. It chronicles wartime advances in plastic surgery (grafts, tissue transfers, the use of ivory), warns against paraffin injections and \u201cguaranteed\u201d beauty operations, and urges choosing reputable surgeons.

{"76694": "\"Hidden seed :  or A year in a girl''s life\" by Emma Leslie is a novel written in the late 19th century. A domestic, didactic coming\u2011of\u2011age tale, it follows earnest fifteen-year-old Mabel Randolph as her zeal to be \u201cuseful\u201d collides with home duties, self-will, and the allure of status when she goes to live with her wealthier relatives and bonds with her gentle, fragile cousin Isabel. The story probes practical Christian service versus pride and worldliness, asking what true inner growth looks like for a young girl.  The opening of Hidden seed traces Mabel\u2019s birthday resolve to be a missionary, her impatience with lessons, and her hasty plunge into parish work that leads to friction at home, including a humiliating outing in a shabby \u201cdistrict\u201d dress and a quarrel with the nurse.

Kept largely to the school-room, Mabel struggles with pride and envy, while Isabel\u2019s quiet kindness steadies her. A visit to an old villager, Mrs. Barker, reframes the parable of the sower as God\u2019s life planted in every heart, warning that weeds of pride and worldliness can choke true growth\u2014an idea that unsettles Mabel. Tensions sharpen around a musical party when Mabel is assigned a difficult sonata that wins little attention, feeding her resentment. Meanwhile, she secretly incurs debt for an evening dress and later uses her spring clothing money to pay it, leaving her in winter browns until her uncle discovers the truth and discreetly helps. The section closes with Mabel chastened but supported, and with hints of Isabel\u2019s delicacy and her tender bond with her father. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76695": "\"Racconti di guerra :  (Maggio 1915 - Novembre 1916)\" by Luigi Ambrosini is a collection of wartime reportage and sketches written in the early 20th century. Through first\u2011person dispatches from Italy\u2019s Adriatic coast and the Alpine front, it portrays soldiers, volunteers, sailors, fishermen, and a frontline medical officer as they face mobilization and combat during World War I. The emphasis is on lived detail and character\u2014marches, night watches, sea work, and field medicine\u2014rather than strategy or heroics.  The opening of this volume follows the narrator along the Adriatic in Romagna and the Marche, where the peaceful countryside gives way to the vast movement of men, guns, and supply columns, and where political \u201creds\u201d and \u201cyellows\u201d now march together as soldiers. He rides at night with a platoon of volunteer cyclists, shares their rough lodging and restless humor, and contrasts their impatience for action with the calm vigilance of a lone sailor at a coastal semaphore, including an episode where volunteers mistake sea phosphorescence for enemy lights. A second section shifts to Fano at dawn, depicting fishermen and their lateen\u2011rigged boats working under wartime restrictions, recalling an Austrian bombardment, setting nets under the eye of the par\u00f2n Guideo, trading stoic talk about loss and honor, and watching dolphins tear their catch as if \u201ceven the dolphins wage war.\u201d The third section sketches a newly minted doctor turned medical officer: a steady, practical man who earns his men\u2019s respect by riding alone through the night to find the unit\u2019s route, then later serves in the trenches. It closes with his letter from an assault near a fort: moonlit wire\u2011cutting, flares, machine\u2011gun fire, and the grim, methodical labor of rescuing and treating the wounded under shell and shrapnel.

The opening of Little Eyebright and her pund o'' care shows Mrs. Mackenzie fretting over health, servants, and money while Mrs. Landor urges her to seek Christ\u2019s promised rest. Mr. Mackenzie, bank manager and ailing, returns home shaken and secretly confides to Euphrasia a looming calamity, perhaps financial, which she must not reveal. Though her conscience wavers, Euphrasia still visits her school friend Letitia in Clifton, where she is coolly received, then badly injures her knee in a fall and becomes an unwanted invalid in the Johnston household; only the doctor, Robert Wells, shows steady kindness. Isolated and letterless, she turns to a hymn on the wideness of God\u2019s mercy and begins to rethink trust, while the scene shifts homeward to show that at least one family letter to her was never sent, explaining part of the silence.

{"76697": "\"Historiallisia kuvauksia h\u00e4t\u00e4ajoilta ja vainovuosilta\" by Petrus Nordmann is a collection of historical sketches written in the late 19th century. It portrays Finland\u2019s ordeals during famine, war, and plague around the turn of the 18th century, focusing on everyday people rather than great leaders. The scenes follow townsfolk, clergy, soldiers, and sailors\u2014such as the conscientious magistrate Jabel, the fisherman Kustaa \u00d6rn, the blunt chaplain Simo Starck, and his soldier-bound son Gideon Gabriel\u2014as they struggle to endure and act with dignity amid scarcity and fear.  The opening of the collection frames the project with an old 1694 hymnbook whose owner\u2019s marginal notes briefly trace a life of campaigns, plague, wounds, captivity, and return, setting a tone of humble witness to hard times. It then moves to Helsinki at the turn of 1695, where a wintry tavern gathering reveals hunger, civic strain, and rough humor as Jabel, raatimies Reimers, craftsmen, and a ruined former scholar quarrel over blame, charity, and survival. Next, in 1697, famine grips the city: Jabel keeps watch for a promised relief ship, desperate beggars plead in the streets, and a fisherman couple bringing fish is mobbed before the community rallies to tow a becalmed grain ship to shore and kneel in thanks. Finally, in Turku, a comic yet telling visit from chaplain Starck to a professor ends with the decision that Starck\u2019s son Gideon will leave his faltering studies and join the cavalry, underscoring how war draws in even the reluctant and unprepared.

{"76698": "\"Valekuollut: 3-n\u00e4yt\u00f6ksinen ilveily\" by Martti Wuori is a theatrical farce written in the early 20th century.

The play\u2019s comic engine is a scheme to stage a death and watch how critics and newspapers react.  The opening of the play shows Eero, broke and humiliated by scathing reviews, sparring with his landlady while his friend Ilmari scrapes together money and Armi rails against lazy critics. When a newspaper stringer arrives as Turpainen\u2019s emissary to press a \u201ckunnianloukkaus\u201d complaint, Eero pointedly refuses to engage. He then decides to disappear and be \u201cvalekuollut,\u201d bidding theatrical farewells and slipping out of town. Act II shifts to Armi taking over Eero\u2019s room as rumors spread: a hat and manuscript pages are found near a railway bridge, and Nestor Nokkonen eagerly amplifies the story. Ilmari, briefly fooled by a dramatic letter, learns from Armi that it\u2019s a ruse; together they let the myth grow to expose Turpainen. The act culminates with Turpainen\u2019s uneasy visit, where Armi coolly parries his overtures while the hoax gathers momentum. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76699": "\"The town down the river :  A book of poems by Edwin Arlington Robinson\" is a collection of poetry written in the early 20th century. The book contemplates ambition, failure, memory, modern life, and moral character, often through portraits of individuals confronting time, loss, and the pressures of society.  The collection opens with a grave homage to Lincoln in The Master and a choric meditation on youth and fate in The Town Down the River, then ranges widely through dramatic monologues and character sketches. An Island voices Napoleon\u2019s bitter exile; the Calverly\u2019s sequence (Leffingwell, Clavering, Lingard) charts bohemian striving and collapse; and the miscellaneous poems move from urban spectacle (The White Lights) to intimate elegy (For a Dead Lady), satire and self-delusion (Miniver Cheevy, Doctor of Billiards), moral quandary (How Annandale Went Out), and parables of procrastination and hope (Vickery\u2019s Mountain, Two Gardens in Linndale). Sea laments, love doubts, and tributes to the dead recur, balancing irony with compassion. The book closes with The Revealer, a public-spirited vision addressing leadership and national conscience, bookending the personal portraits with a civic appeal. Throughout, plainspoken music and keen psychology reveal lives poised between aspiration and resignation. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76700": "\"Good Friday, and other poems\" by John Masefield is a poetry collection written in the early 20th century. It centers on a dramatic retelling of the Passion through the voices of Pilate, his wife Procula, the centurion Longinus, a priestly envoy, a blind madman, Joseph of Ramah, and Herod, then broadens into sonnets meditating on beauty, the self, faith and doubt, nature, death, and war. The likely focus is the conflict between conscience and authority, and how suffering and beauty reveal deeper truth.  The opening of the collection stages the Pavement outside the Roman citadel in Jerusalem, where Pilate, swayed by Procula\u2019s ominous dream and a priest\u2019s charge that Jesus claims kingship, wavers but finally condemns him as the crowd clamors for crucifixion. A blind madman pleads for mercy, Pilate posts the inscription \u201cKing of the Jews,\u201d and the soldiers lead Jesus away; darkness and an earthquake follow, Longinus returns shaken by the portents, Joseph of Ramah secures permission to bury the body, and Herod arrives to make a political peace with Pilate as the mob cheers. After this dramatic scene, the text shifts to sonnets that probe beauty, the inner self, mortality, possible afterlives, nature\u2019s cycles, the ruptures of war, and recurring Good Friday imagery, before this excerpt closes with \u201cThe Madman\u2019s Song,\u201d a parable of a besieged city saved by the scorned wisdom of a madman.

Expect frontier perils, commercial rivalries, and cross-cultural encounters, with figures like the suave Don Tiburcio and trader-leader Ceran St. Vrain shaping the journey.  The opening of the novel contrasts two worlds: a siesta-stilled Spanish Santa Fe where restless Consuelo longs for excitement, and bustling New Orleans where Steven is drawn to the river trade and overland commerce. In Santa Fe, Consuelo bristles at stifling courtship from cousin Manuel, thrills at the American caravans, and is captivated\u2014despite herself\u2014by the return of the aristocratic merchant Don Tiburcio, whose train arrives to great fanfare. Meanwhile in New Orleans, Steven is inspired by tales of the Trail, secures an introduction to St. Vrain, and accepts a secret dispatch from the deposed Mexican president G\u00f3mez Pedraza before running away to join a westbound caravan. Reaching Independence, he equips himself, joins St. Vrain\u2019s column, endures storms and night guard, survives a deadly grapple with a scouting warrior, and witnesses a buffalo stampede and tense but bloodless contact with Plains Indians. The train pushes past Pawnee Rock, fights thirst and insects, fords rivers by moonlight, and makes desperate water runs as it turns onto the harsher Cimarron route. Early in the desert stretch they discover a besieged, muleless party\u2014including a pale young woman and her brother\u2014whom they fold into their own train and lead back toward water, rationing the last canteens as the noon heat bears down.

{"76707": "\"Ancient Rhetoric and Poetic: Interpreted from Representative Works\" by Charles Sears Baldwin is a scholarly treatise written in the early 20th century. It surveys classical theories of rhetoric and poetics through representative authors to recover practical principles of composition for modern readers. The work argues for a twofold view of composition\u2014rhetoric as public, logical persuasion and poetic as imaginative movement\u2014while tracing how ancient practice informs medieval pedagogy and Renaissance criticism.  The opening of the book sets out the author\u2019s purpose and method in a preface: to let figures like Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and the author of \u201cOn the Sublime\u201d speak for themselves, with a strict focus on composition and a deliberate exclusion of metrics. Chapter I distinguishes rhetoric from poetic not by verse versus prose, but by the kind of movement\u2014idea-to-idea for rhetoric versus image-to-image for poetic\u2014while acknowledging shared stylistic resources and emphasizing the pedagogical value of the distinction. Chapter II then begins a sustained reading of Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric: Book I defines rhetoric as discerning the available means of persuasion (with the enthymeme as its chief instrument) and maps deliberative, forensic, and occasional speech with their core topics. Book II shifts to the audience, analyzing emotions and character types to guide ethical adaptation. Book III turns to the speech itself\u2014diction, rhythm, the periodic sentence, delivery, and the traditional parts\u2014arguing that prose should be rhythmical but not metrical, and that vivid metaphor, energetic presentation, and apt arrangement make ideas act \u201cbefore the eyes.\u201d (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}

{"76709": "\"Yleiskatsaus \u00e4\u00e4nioikeusasiaan Suomessa by Santeri Ivalo\" is a political pamphlet written in the late 19th century. The book examines the suffrage question in Finland, arguing that existing voting arrangements are unjust and outdated, and calls for broader, fairer participation in public life.  The author opens with Finland\u2019s rapid 19th\u2011century progress and the ensuing \u201cbacklash,\u201d then surveys, in turn, rural municipal elections, rural elections to the peasants\u2019 estate, urban municipal elections, urban elections to the burghers\u2019 estate, and church elections. He shows how property-based and weighted voting (with multiple votes tied to tax payments) lets a small, wealthy minority overrule majorities, how indirect elections dampen civic engagement, and how high tax thresholds exclude many workers entirely. He demands immediate, practical reforms within the four-estate system: extend the franchise in the countryside to all tax\u2011paying, reputable residents; abolish indirect elections; set a clear, low suffrage threshold; and replace all vote-scaling with equal voting\u2014\u201cone man, one vote.\u201d He identifies reform of the burghers\u2019 estate as pivotal for broader change, supports curbing wealth-based dominance in church elections, and reinforces his case with stark numerical examples showing how little of the nation truly holds power. He concludes that equal suffrage is both a question of justice and a national necessity to strengthen unity and self-government. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76710": "\"Ellice Quentin, and other stories\" by Julian Hawthorne is a collection of short stories written in the late 19th century. The volume blends psychological romance, social satire, and moral crisis, opening with a passionate love story that collides with ambition and fate, and shifting to continental settings for intrigue and adventure. Its characters\u2014most notably the mercurial Ellice Quentin and the steadfast barrister Geoffrey Herne\u2014face choices where love, pride, and worldly allure pull in opposite directions.  The opening of the book begins with a preface championing brevity in fiction, then launches into Ellice Quentin: Geoffrey and Ellice fall intensely in love, but she abandons their engagement to secure an inheritance through marriage to another man, only to return years later torn between worldly glitter and the deeper claim of love. A charged reunion at a garden party leads to Geoffrey\u2019s uncompromising ultimatum; two years on, she reappears saying she has left her husband, but Geoffrey reveals he is engaged to Gertrude. Ellice insists on meeting the new fianc\u00e9e, pours three glasses of wine, and, having contrived a fatal choice for herself alone, dies moments after toasting them, leaving Geoffrey stricken and Gertrude stunned. The next tale, The Countess\u2019s Ruby, opens on a Norman seaside: an English artist-narrator and his ardent American poet friend trade banter amid beach theatrics, a striking \u201cpagan\u201d beauty in a canoe, and a comic mishap with a missing peignoir, before a fog rolls in and the swimmer-poet vanishes into the haze, hinting at peril and further intrigue.

{"76711": "\"Kaspar Hauser : Beispiel eines Verbrechens am Seelenleben des Menschen\" by Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach is a legal-psychological case study written in the early 19th century. It investigates the sensational appearance of the foundling Kaspar Hauser in Nuremberg, recording his condition, behaviors, and the documents and objects found with him. Through careful observation and legal reasoning, it contends that beyond unlawful imprisonment and exposure, a profound offense was committed against a human mind.  The opening of the work recounts Hauser\u2019s sudden arrival in Nuremberg: a staggering youth in peasant dress who could barely walk, repeated set phrases, refused meat and beer, ate only bread and water, and yet wrote his name clearly. Taken to the police tower, he is inventoried (ill-fitting clothes, devotional tracts, a rosary) and found with letters addressed to a cavalry officer and notes hinting at his supposed birth and soldier father; medical observations describe soft, blistered feet, unusual knees, and extreme sensitivity. His behavior is strikingly childlike\u2014few words (calling people \u201cboys\u201d and all animals \u201chorses\u201d), terror of black animals, fascination with toy horses, astonishment at mirrors and music, and no grasp of religion\u2014while the jailer Hiltel and visitors attest to his innocence and rapid, effortful learning. As crowds gather, Professor Daumer begins to teach him and the mayor Binder pieces together an initial narrative: lifelong confinement in a small dark room, fed bread and water (sometimes drugged), nails trimmed in sleep, a hidden keeper who guided his hand to write and later forced him to stand and walk, then carried him out and abandoned him in the city. Feuerbach frames this as aggravated unlawful imprisonment and life-endangering exposure, proposing a broader \u201ccrime against the soul.\u201d The author\u2019s first visit adds vivid details: hypersensitive eyes, facial tics under mental strain, third\u2011person self-reference, a strong preference for red, and a fierce, touching eagerness to learn and draw.

{"76712": "\"Gleanings in Europe :  Italy, vol. 1 of 2\" by James Fenimore Cooper is a travelogue written in the early 19th century. It presents an American traveler\u2019s lettered impressions of Italy\u2019s cities, roads, art, inns, and society, mixing scenes on the way with historical reflection and sharp, often humorous, observation. The narrative moves from market squares and river crossings to galleries, salons, and a ducal court, shaping a vivid portrait of Italy\u2019s landscapes and manners as seen by a curious, independent-minded visitor.  The opening of the work follows the narrator from Milan across the Lombard plain to Lodi (with a quack tooth-puller and heaps of frog legs), offering a skeptical retelling of the battle at the Adda before crossing the Po to Piacenza and through the duchy of Parma, Modena, and Bologna. He notes Austrian garrisons and decayed brick walls, learns to bargain at inns, inspects Castle Guelfo, admires Parma\u2019s Correggio and the separate campanile and baptistery, remarks on Modena\u2019s polished composition floors, and strolls Bologna\u2019s snow-proof arcades and leaning towers. A mountain crossing brings a comic scare about banditti (a \u201csuspect\u201d peasant proves to be summoning oxen), a courier\u2019s trick that costs him rooms, a solitary inn with honest hosts, and finally Florence\u2014with its marbled cathedral square and oversized mosquitoes. Settling in a Florentine palazzo-fortress, he describes cheap grand lodgings, noble families selling wine by the flask, the gentle, indolent Tuscan temperament, and moving encounters with antique masterpieces in the tribune, then surveys a cosmopolitan winter scene: diplomats, English amateur theatricals (and a coarse caricature of Americans), Prince Borghese\u2019s receptions, and a starry opera audience. A coastal excursion takes him through Lucca and Pisa (arguing the leaning tower was designed to lean), the Campo Santo and tiny Moorish-gothic Spina chapel, and to Leghorn\u2019s port where he relishes the sea air, hears praise of the American ship Delaware, visits the Protestant cemetery (Smollett and a fallen U.S. officer), and warns invalids off Italy\u2019s winter climate. He then recounts a formal audience at the Pitti\u2014details of dress, etiquette, Habsburg-Lorraine succession, and a frank exchange with the Grand Duke about America\u2014closing with political reflections on monarchy and aristocracy. The section ends amid carnival gaiety at a masked ball, with white dominos, a Polish dance, towering English guardsmen, and musings on how easy travel blends nations and spreads opinions.

It centers on a society wife''s risky scheme to fake a jewel robbery to cover her gambling losses, entangling a straight-arrow detective and her well-meaning husband in a clever, lighthearted twist on theft and trust.  Betty Danford, having pawned her diamond wedding necklace and replaced it with paste, begs Detective Harry Milholland\u2014an old suitor\u2014to arrange a staged burglary to \u201csteal\u201d the fake and keep her secret. Her plan unravels when her husband, Chester, reveals he has quietly redeemed the real necklace and hidden it back in her dressing table. Panicked, Betty rushes to stop the planned theft, only to witness what looks like a thief flinging the necklace into the river. The sting is then revealed: Harry had told Chester, they orchestrated a fake confrontation, and the tossed necklace was only the paste copy. With the truth out and the real diamonds safe, Betty faces a gentle moral reckoning, reconciles with her husband, and the tale ends on a playful, affectionate note.

{"76714": "\"The Little Review, July 1917 (Vol. 4, No. 3) by Margaret C. Anderson\" is a modernist arts magazine issue compiled in the early 20th century. It showcases avant-garde poetry, fiction, and polemic, with editorial notices and reader correspondence framing a spirited debate about art, society, and the war. The likely topic is a bold presentation of experimental literature and cultural criticism that rejects conventional taste.  The issue opens with Wyndham Lewis\u2019s Imaginary Letters, a spiky \u201cCode of a Herdsman\u201d that exalts individuality over the \u201cherd,\u201d urging multiple selves, a personal vocabulary, and ruthless honesty. T. S. Eliot contributes four poems\u2014satirizing reactionary journalism, skipping through cosmopolitan personae, setting a squalid honeymoon against Byzantine splendor, and skewering ecclesiastical complacency in \u201cThe Hippopotamus.\u201d Ezra Pound\u2019s \u201cAux Etuves de Wiesbaden\u201d stages a 15th\u2011century bathhouse dialogue on cleanliness, Christianity, Spartan customs, beauty, and the dangers of dogma. John Rodker\u2019s \u201cThree Nightpieces\u201d render panic, marital dread, and nightmare in clipped, hallucinatory scenes. Louis Gilmore\u2019s \u201cImprovisations\u201d offer imagist miniatures on the mind and the seasons; Maxwell Bodenheim\u2019s \u201cPoet\u2019s Heart\u201d is a symbolic drama of seekers (a shepherd, peddler, nun, and wine\u2011jar maiden) who are gathered by a Poet into his inner garden; and Emanuel Morgan\u2019s \u201cOpus 96\u201d is a brief hymn to perpetual beauty. \u201cThe Reader Critic\u201d section bristles with attacks and defenses\u2014on taste, modernism, and the war\u2014quoting Barbusse on the horror of combat, noting the Goldman\u2011Berkman prosecutions, and asserting the magazine\u2019s uncompromising stance, while announcements trail forthcoming work by Yeats and Joyce alongside the usual advertisements and subscription appeals.

{"76715": "\"La signora Inger di \u00d6strot\" by Henrik Ibsen is a play written in the mid-19th century. Set in 16th-century Norway, it is a historical drama of political intrigue and moral reckoning, centered on Lady Inger, her daughter Elina, the Danish courtier Nils Lykke, and the exiled noble Olaf Skaktavl as rebellion brews and a rumored Sture heir unsettles the region. The work explores how private guilt and ambition collide with national hopes, with a powerful matriarch forced to choose between prudence and revolt.  The opening of the play shows \u00d6strot at night during a storm: servants gossip about Norway\u2019s decline and a black-clad presence haunting the manor, while peasants demand arms to join the Dalecarlian rising. Lady Inger first yields, then abruptly halts their departure after a secret letter warns of a visitor, sparking a fierce clash with Elina over past compromises, a sister sacrificed to a political marriage, and another ruined by a seducer. The ragged stranger proves to be Olaf Skaktavl, who presses for action as a Danish envoy, Nils Lykke, arrives with smooth promises and a hidden plan to ensnare the Sture pretender; Inger parries him, even staging a mock \u201cpoisoned cup\u201d test to expose both Danish and compatriot mistrust. Act III opens with Elina\u2019s proud defiance as Lykke tries to charm and justify himself, turning their midnight encounter into a tense duel of hatred, persuasion, and unsettled feeling.

{"76716": "The Palace of Fantasy; or, The Bard\u2019s Imagery; with Other Poems by J. S. Hardy is a collection of poetry written in the mid-19th century. It centers on an extended allegorical tour in which personified Fantasy appoints a Bard to guide a crowd through a visionary palace and across the realms of Nature, Art, Learning, and Science. The aim is to delight and morally elevate the careworn, turning everyday drudgery toward wonder, knowledge, and a nobler destiny.  The opening of the work frames the design: Fantasy\u2019s herald summons a weary populace to a hidden palace, where a page attires them and a saloon of living tapestries sets the tone for a grand imaginative voyage. Dan Fantasy addresses the crowd with compassion and assigns the Bard to lead them first through subterranean caverns and grottoes to marvels of the earth, then out to vast prospects. The path forks into four domains; beginning with Nature, the Bard swiftly paints Alpine heights, polar ice, torrents and ocean storms, basalt caves, island lakes, and deep forests, mixing awe with moral reflection and a hope of future peace. Turning to Art, the tour surveys ancient wonders and ruins, then a gallery of masters, music, and sculpture, and glimpses of Milton, Newton, and Shakespeare, before celebrating modern invention from steam power to the printing press. In Learning, the company wanders academies and libraries among the great names of philosophy and letters. In Science, they ascend a night-tower to read the heavens\u2014moon, planets, comets, and the milky way\u2014and the Bard closes this opening movement with reflections on cosmic order and the earth\u2019s harmonious course.

{"76717": "\"The history of fashion in France :  or, the dress of women from the Gallo-Roman\u2026.\" by Augustin Challamel is a historical account written in the late 19th century. It charts the evolution of French women\u2019s dress from ancient Gaul through the Middle Ages to the author\u2019s present, treating clothing as a social and moral barometer. The work highlights Paris\u2019s leadership in style and the roles of actresses, fashion journals, and even dressed dolls in spreading trends, and it promises a period-by-period survey from the Gallo-Roman era onward.  The opening of the volume presents fashion as a serious lens on society, quoting poets, praising Frenchwomen\u2019s taste, and placing Paris at the center of global style. It illustrates celebrity influence with Mlle. Mars\u2019s famous yellow gown, sketches the rise of fashion media from Amman\u2019s Gyn\u00e6ceum to Lam\u00e9sang\u00e8re\u2019s Journal des Dames et des Modes, mentions dolls used to export styles, and lays out a plan to cover each era. The first chapters then describe Gallic and Gallo-Roman attire\u2014woad-stained skin yielding to tunics, veils (mavors and palla), Roman stolae, perfumes and cosmetics, jewelry, specialized footwear, fans, and cooling amber or crystal balls\u2014before moving to Merovingian and early Carlovingian fashions shaped by Frankish rule: skins and camlets, coifs and veils (including the obbou), jeweled belts, braided hair, and modesty enforced by custom and church. They profile royal women and manuscript images to detail belts, veils, colors, and cleanliness (including baths), and then trace the shift to distinctly French medieval styles: dominical veils, bliauds and garde-corps, afiche clasps and serpent-trains, surcoats and hoods, emblazoned gowns, and a growing variety of fabrics.

{"76718": "\"Russian essays and stories\" by Maurice Baring is a collection of essays and short stories written in the early 20th century. It offers a wide-ranging portrait of Russian life\u2014travel sketches, cultural criticism, stage and literature notes, and reportage\u2014rounded off with short fiction drawn from the same milieu. The emphasis is on impartial, first-hand observation of ordinary people\u2014peasants, workers, soldiers, officials, and merchants\u2014encountered across trains, rivers, fairs, and provincial towns.  The opening of the collection frames a pledge of non-polemical truth-telling in a witty dedication and preface, then launches into vivid travel pieces. First come third-class railway journeys north and west of Moscow: cramped night rides, sharp dialogue about the Duma and mutinies, a comic quarrel with a guard, Kronstadt dockers trading English phrases, a near-theft at Vologda station, and recruits and a feldsher debating war and reform. Next, the Volga voyage unfolds: Yaroslavl\u2019s twilight streets, the teeming Nijni-Novgorod Fair and its Liberal press, family debates over a borrowed novel, and the river\u2019s grandeur down past Kazan, Samara, Saratov, and Tzaritsyn to Astrakhan\u2014punctuated by generous third-class cabins, Cossack banter, a would\u2011be opera singer, folk hauling songs, and the night scent of new-mown hay. Returning inland, station halls brim with sleepers and sunflower seeds, and a guarded cashier hints at unrest. The sketches then shift south to contrast Central and Little Russia, a blind hurdy-gurdy player, and a train debate where a soldier\u2019s blunt theism clashes with a monk\u2014leading to reflections on the peasants\u2019 practical mysticism capped by two stark anecdotes. A talk with a moderate landowner probes \u201cculture\u201d and weighs Turgenev\u2019s artistry against the tougher realities of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, and the final pages begin the ceremony of casting a village bell.

{"76719": "\"The new art of writing plays by Lope de Vega\" is a dramaturgical treatise in verse from the Spanish Golden Age, likely the early 17th century. It outlines how to craft stage plays that satisfy audience taste while engaging with classical theory, blending practical stagecraft with a poet\u2019s reflections on comedy and tragedy.  The book opens with a contextual introduction that sets the author alongside the great innovators of popular theater and frames his core paradox: he knows the classical rules yet openly breaks them to please the paying crowd. The central poem addresses an academy, briefly surveys the origins of comedy and tragedy, and then offers concise, practice-first guidance: choose a single, coherent action; build plays in three acts; compress time where possible; keep the stage seldom empty; delay the resolution until the final moments; and mix tragic and comic tones for variety. It advises writing the plan in prose before versifying, matching speech to character and situation, and using distinct verse forms for different purposes (for lament, narration, high matters, or love). It favors themes of honor and virtue, warns against impossibilities and open satire, prescribes moderate length, and urges decorum and plausible costume. The author closes by acknowledging his own vast, rule-breaking output and defending it on the grounds that playwrights must live by pleasing the public.

Jokamies boasts of his wealth, spurns a needy neighbor, and coldly defends usury; his mother urges him toward repentance and marriage, but he turns instead to revels with his beloved and friends. In the midst of a feast he hears ominous calls; Death appears and commands him to come at once, granting only a brief chance to find a companion. His closest friend and two cousins refuse to go; his servants flee; even Mammon rises from his treasure chest to mock him and deny aid.

{"76728": "Helen Vardon\u2019s Confession by R. Austin Freeman is a detective novel written in the early 20th century. It centers on Helen Vardon, a solicitor\u2019s daughter, whose father\u2019s misapplied trust funds lead to blackmail and a coerced marriage proposal. The narrative promises a blend of domestic tragedy, romance, and crime as Helen\u2019s sacrifice draws her into deeper peril.  The opening of the novel presents Helen deciding to set down her story after glimpsing a first white hair, a small shock that recalls past terrors. She overhears a devastating conversation: her father has improperly used trust money, faces possible imprisonment, and a powerful acquaintance, Lewis Otway, offers to cover the loss if she will marry him. Fearing her father may take a desperate way out, Helen secretly meets Otway, signs a written promise to marry under strict conditions, and obtains his letter that temporarily removes the threat, which she delivers unseen to calm her father. Over the next days she hides her plan, writes a brief farewell-explanation, and arranges a clandestine ceremony. At the mission church, numb and detached, she stands with Otway as the hurried, hushed marriage service begins, her vows spoken as a grim act of rescue rather than love.

Set entirely in a manor house kitchen, it explores the lives of servants\u2014flirtations, jealousy, gossip, and superstition\u2014leading to a sudden stroke of luck that reshapes their futures.  In the kitchen bustle, maid Hanna and stablehand Pekka are engaged, but the bookkeeper Aukusti flirts with Hanna, provoking the spiteful jealousy of the lady\u2019s maid Anna. Slander travels upstairs: Pekka is summarily dismissed (under the pretext of a lame horse), and Hanna is fired for supposed impropriety. Ristiina the cook, guided by a vivid dream, splits a raffle ticket with Hanna; soon Reetta brings news that their ticket has won a major prize. Fortune reverses the injustice: Pekka and Hanna can now marry and start a life of their own, while the steady coachman Juronen\u2014long prudent and patient\u2014proposes to Ristiina, and they plan to open a well-run eatery. Amid banter and quick turns, camaraderie and chance triumph over malice and class-bound pettiness. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76730": "\"Terveeks'' \u2014 Buddha!\" by Sulo-Weikko Pekkola is a travelogue written in the early 20th century. It follows a Finnish traveler moving from the Middle East into British India and across Southeast Asia toward Australia, blending shipboard episodes, rail journeys, and street-level sketches of colonial cities. Told in an anecdotal, often humorous and sometimes sharply opinionated voice, it focuses on everyday encounters, language barriers, and the social hierarchies of empire.  The opening of the narrative finds the author abandoning an overland entry to India in favor of a British India Steam Navigation ship from Basra, sharing a cabin with Hindu officers, watching deck passengers cook amid monsoon swells, and arriving via Karachi to Bombay. First impressions emphasize how European parts of Indian port cities appear, contrasted with crowded stations, third-class train travel, improvised smoking customs, and a grim episode of suspected sabotage leading to a wreck. He comments on language gaps despite imperial English, offers blunt (often biased) notes on local habits like crouching by the tracks and the status of sacred animals, and describes a hawk taking a street chicken. Reaching Singapore, he depicts a cosmopolitan, Chinese-dominated port with fine roads, open drains, foul river, trolley-like buses, and visits to rubber estates and the botanic garden; he relies on a newspaper editor rather than a consul for access. Street vignettes include anti-English sentiment, getting lost, gold-teeth smiles, noisy lodgings with piano and violin, bath tubs as water boxes, a nearby mosque and guarded harem, and an episode with a neighbor\u2019s wheezing accordion. The section closes with visa bureaucracy for Australia resolved by an English officer upstairs and the sight of a lively, music-led Chinese funeral procession.

{"76731": "\"Sibylla :  or, The revival of prophecy by C. A. Mace\" is a speculative essay written in the early 20th century. It proposes that \u201cprophecy\u201d can be revived as disciplined scientific forecasting, arguing that modern science and psychology will increasingly predict\u2014and deliberately shape\u2014the future of society, industry, education, politics, and even human nature.  Mace surveys recent \u201cprophetic\u201d thinking, contrasts gadget-focused futurism with biologically minded forecasts, and then sketches a coming revolution: the scientific management of mind and behavior. Using examples from industrial psychology, he shows how incentives, environment, and subtle social levers can steer work, policy, and public opinion, predicting propaganda refined into a precise art, humor as a political weapon, and war fought mainly by psychological means. He foresees education reorganized around natural rhythms and lifelong study, a tight weave of factory\u2013school\u2013clinic guidance, and universities challenged by mass broadcasting. He extends this control to eugenics and selection, speculates on altered senses, memory, and specialized languages, and traces moral trends toward reduced cruelty and self-conscious, cooler emotions. Society, he suggests, will stratify into a small, tested technocratic elite and a contented majority, with sport fading as work and play merge under scientific planning. He closes by questioning whether such mastery brings happiness or virtue, noting that desire expands as achievement does, leaving fulfillment perpetually just out of reach.

{"76732": "\"Songs and rhymes of a lead miner\" by Thomas Grierson Gracie is a collection of poems and songs written in the early 20th century. The volume evokes the work, landscape, and community life of Wanlockhead and the Lowther Hills, told in Scots dialect and plainspoken English. It mingles nature sketches, mining-life vignettes, village customs, and music-making with elegies and patriotic verses shaped by the Great War. Expect intimate local color, moral reflections, and occasional humor from a miner-musician\u2019s point of view.  The opening of the collection begins with a candid preface in which the author recounts a hard childhood in Wanlockhead, years as a lead and coal miner, his love of the fiddle, and his turn to rhyming during wartime, stressing that he writes for ordinary folk and thanking local editors and friends. It then moves through descriptive pieces: moonlit winter vistas over the Lowthers that prompt a prayer for peace, comic and lively accounts of fishing trips and a grouse meet, a breathless otter hunt, a graveside procession, and lyrical walks along Mennock Burn and the Heights of Glendyne. Village life and memory follow\u2014an old-time wedding, affection for a family wall clock amid modern inventions, a satire of a sour \u201cCurmudgeon,\u201d praise of local rivers and a memorial seat\u2014before a series of in memoriam poems for townsfolk and soldiers, tributes to volunteers, and a tender lament for a pit pony. The Songs section mixes nostalgia and courtship with mining humor (\u201cLevel No. 6,\u201d an emergency pump), recruiting and morale numbers, and local portraits, while the Miscellaneous pieces turn to social critique (\u201cScunner\u2019t\u201d), a toast to an absent friend, and a closing, unfinished portrait of the miner\u2019s steadfastness.

{"76733": "\"Celtic art in Pagan and Christian times\" by J. Romilly Allen is a scholarly archaeological and art-historical study written in the early 20th century. It investigates the origins, development, and motifs of Celtic art in Britain and Ireland across two broad phases\u2014pagan and Christian\u2014set against Continental cultures such as Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne. Drawing on excavations, museum collections, and comparative ornament, the work explains how patterns like spirals, chevrons, and knotwork evolved and appeared on metalwork, pottery, sculpture, and, by analogy, illuminated manuscripts.  The opening of the study states its aim to synthesize current evidence on Celtic art\u2019s origins and growth, crediting recent discoveries (Aylesford, Glastonbury, Hunsbury; Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne; Marne cemeteries) for reshaping the timeline and sources of influence. It sketches the Celts in Classical literature and art, then pivots to archaeology to define the Hallstatt (earlier) and La T\u00e8ne (later) Iron Age cultures, their weapons, fibulae, shields, helmets, and the role of Greek trade in shaping Gaulish styles; it also stresses the Celts\u2019 habit of imitating foreign coinage. The narrative then traces how Goidelic Celts entered Bronze Age Britain, encountering Neolithic Iberian-like populations, and distinguishes Goidels and Brythons linguistically (Q vs P) and culturally (Bronze vs Early Iron Age), before proposing broad Bronze Age chronologies. At the start of the art discussion, the book catalogs the primary evidence\u2014barrows, settlements, hoards, stray finds, and rock carvings\u2014and shows how Bronze Age burial customs and pottery types (cinerary urns, food-vessels, drinking-cups, incense-cups) are decorated chiefly with chevron-based geometric schemes executed by impressing cords, tools, and stamps. It explains, with clear geometric breakdowns, how triangles, lozenges, saltires, and hexagon effects derive from the chevron, and contrasts these with spiral motifs found on carved stones (notably at Newgrange) rather than on British bronzes. The section closes by linking those spirals to Scandinavian Bronze Age metalwork, underscoring a web of Continental connections. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}

It offers a miscellany of practical science, history, moral instruction, literature, and cultural notes aimed at general readers, with a clear focus on diffusing useful knowledge and encouraging self-improvement.  This issue ranges widely: a data-rich article on butter surveys production, trade, and global uses (from Indian ghee to Arab consumption and London demand); an eloquent reflection \u201cOf Peace\u201d (after Clarendon); Benjamin Franklin\u2019s list of moral virtues and a daily schedule; and a report on schooling in Smyrna, especially among Greeks. A calendar of notable dates sketches Dante, William Pitt, the Restoration, Ascension Day, and Poussin. A substantial museum essay explains the \u201cYounger Memnon\u201d colossus and Belzoni\u2019s removal of it. A moral tale, \u201cThe Flute-Player,\u201d shows a marriage rescued by kindness, moderation, and the restoration of innocent recreation. There\u2019s a note on the arrival of forks in England, poems by Wordsworth and (attributed) Southey, and a string of concise lessons and anecdotes on late learning, temperance, wise rulership, longevity through virtue, naval architecture, and the statistical regularity of mortality\u2014all serving the magazine\u2019s blend of edification and accessible curiosity.

{"76735": "\"Winnetou :  Het opperhoofd der Apachen\" by Karl May is a novel written in the late 19th century. Set in the American West, it traces a young German newcomer who grows into \u201cOld Shatterhand\u201d and forms a profound friendship with the Apache chief Winnetou amid surveying missions, frontier peril, and cultural conflict. The tale blends high adventure with a passionate critique of the injustices done to Native Americans.  The opening of the novel begins with a heartfelt preface mourning the decline of Indigenous peoples and announcing the story as a memorial to Winnetou. It then follows a self-styled \u201cgreenhorn\u201d in St. Louis who impresses a gruff gunsmith, Mr. Henry, with extraordinary marksmanship, subdues a vicious horse, and\u2014thanks to a discreet \u201cexamination\u201d\u2014is recruited as a surveyor for a railroad expedition, receiving a gifted rifle and mount and meeting the guides Sam Hawkins, Dick Stone, and Willy Parker. On the Canadian River section, the work stalls under a drunken chief and lazy guards while the narrator quietly does the real labor; a visiting engineer, Mr. White, exposes the mismanagement.

{"76736": "\"L''Afrique centrale fran\u00e7aise : R\u00e9cit du voyage de la mission\" by Auguste Chevalier et al. is a scientific travel account and expedition report written in the early 20th century. It chronicles the French Chari\u2013Lake Chad mission through Central Africa, blending route narratives with studies in botany, geology, ethnography, and colonial economics. The focus is on mapping regions between the Congo, Oubangui, and Lake Chad, establishing experimental gardens, and assessing resources such as rubber, copal, and food crops within the context of French colonial administration.  The opening of this account explains how the mission was conceived, funded, and staffed, outlining official backing, scientific aims, and the team\u2019s roles. It follows the party from France to Brazzaville via the Congo railway, contrasts the disrepair of Brazzaville with the orderly Belgian L\u00e9opoldville, and details early botanical work that identifies the so\u2011called \u201cgrass-root rubber\u201d from Landolphia species. The narrative then shifts to the river journey up the Congo and Oubangui toward Bangui, with close observation of forests, islands, copal and oil palms, village agriculture, and abandoned settlements linked to recent unrest, while noting evolving local customs and the spread of introduced crops.

{"76737": "The sociable ghost :  Being the adventures of a reporter who was invited by the\u2026. by Olive Harper is a satirical supernatural novel written in the early 20th century. Set in and beneath New York\u2019s Trinity Churchyard, it follows a young newspaper man and a loquacious \u201cSociable Ghost\u201d through a night of ghostly revels\u2014banquets, dances, and conventions\u2014used to lampoon high society, publishers, and pious pretenses. The tone is comic and irreverent, mixing urban history with witty afterlife etiquette and class commentary.  The opening of the novel finds a heartbroken reporter brooding in Trinity churchyard, where the graves stir and a sardonic ghost borrows his pipe and whiskey, then guides him through a cemetery tour laced with jokes about epitaphs, cherub carvings, \u201cpassports\u201d for the dead, and the folly of memorial sentiment. The ghost explains this is the one night ghosts may freely walk, previews an underground convention and ball, mocks mediums, and gossips about the famous (including a vignette of John Jacob Astor\u2019s spirit happily working an old baling press). Led through the Lawrence tomb into a vast, flower-lit hall curated by a grand social impresario, the reporter witnesses a chaotic card-room episode where a hulking professional gambler unwillingly teaches six lady ghosts poker with beans, and then hears a \u201cmended ghost\u201d recount the brutal mishandling of remains during a church vault relocation.

{"76738": "\"Delle speranze d''Italia\" by conte Cesare Balbo is a political treatise written in the mid-19th century. It argues for a moderate, practical path to Italian nationhood: rejecting both reactionary conservatism and revolutionary maximalism, and favoring a confederation of the existing states to secure independence\u2014especially from Austrian dominance\u2014while acknowledging the moral influence of the papacy. The work engages current debates sparked by Vincenzo Gioberti and seeks to ground hope in realistic institutions, historical precedent, and steady reform.  The opening of the treatise sets its purpose through two dedications to Gioberti, praising his stimulus while declaring a distinct, moderate course against the \u201cextremes\u201d and the \u201cdespairing.\u201d Balbo asserts that Italy\u2019s political order is unsound chiefly because it lacks full national independence, a defect that distorts all other institutions and even weakens the papacy\u2019s spiritual authority when its temporal power appears dependent. He then surveys potential arrangements: he rejects a unitary kingdom of Italy as impractical and divisive (not least because of the papal question), dismisses a neo\u2011Ghibelline \u201cAustrian Italy\u201d as both impossible and harmful, and rebuffs a patchwork of small republics as regressive and unviable. In contrast, he endorses a confederation of existing states, citing Italian precedents from the Etruscans to the Lombard League and Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, while cautioning against over\u2011specifying details like a papal presidency; he closes this opening by naming the chief immediate obstacle to any confederation: Austria\u2019s entrenched dominance within the peninsula.

Set in Sweden, it follows Gunnar Hede, a gifted violinist and heir desperate to save the Monnikshut estate, and Ingrid, a gentle orphan whose life intersects with his. Mixing folk-legend atmosphere with romance and moral struggle, it explores art, duty, love, and the pull of home.  The opening follows Gunnar Hede in Uppsala as a blunt friend warns him that his family estate is failing and his violin obsession has stalled his studies. After a street performance reveals his power to move crowds, Gunnar resolves to earn money, later taking to the road as a peddler; a disastrous winter drive with hundreds of goats and a broken engagement unhinge him, and he becomes the half-mad wanderer people call \u201cGeitebok.\u201d The scene shifts to Roglanda, where the dreamy, put-upon Ingrid, adopted by a poor pastor\u2019s family, falls gravely ill, lapses into a trance, and is buried as if dead.

It traces the author\u2019s path from a prophetic birth at the family estate M\u00e5rbacka through illness, avid reading, first encounters with theater, education, and the slow, determined making of a writer. Along the way she reflects on the genesis of her major works and on travels\u2014including to Jerusalem\u2014that shaped her themes and resolve. The focus is intimate and reflective, centered on how a life of stories becomes a life in literature.  The opening of this memoir begins with the night of the author\u2019s birth, when Aunt Wennervik\u2019s card reading predicts frail health, much travel, lifelong work, and a life with books. Childhood illness keeps her indoors, where a lurid adventure novel awakens her desire to write; a winter in Stockholm restores her strength and introduces the stage, leading to home theatricals and dreams of playwriting, followed by the heady discovery of writing her first lines of verse. As a young woman she endures anxious days awaiting admission to the teachers\u2019 seminary and succeeds, convinced she must gain knowledge to earn her living and to write well; later, in Jerusalem, a sand-divining seer assures her the book she plans about Swedish settlers there will come to fruition.

Expect seasonal field sketches that blend storytelling with fieldcraft, encouraging readers\u2014especially the young\u2014to notice, collect, and care about the living world.  The opening of the work sets out a friendly preface: these \u201cnature albums\u201d are meant to put good color plates and real outdoor experience within easy reach, so that young people learn nature by seeing. It quickly shifts into lively dune vignettes: a teacher\u2019s cheerful \u201crabbit hunt\u201d with pupils for skulls becomes a lesson in snares, scavengers, and rabbit life (burrows, frosty signs, rampant breeding, evening grazing). A birch-dale chapter follows with bark and fungus, then moths and larvae as masters of disguise (buff-tip, peppered moth, emerald), plus birds such as nightingale, song thrush, willow warbler, and a few deft plant notes (violets\u2019 self-fertilizing flowers, garlic mustard with orange-tip). A June evening piece captures flowers closing and opening, moth- and hawk-moth pollination, and the arrival of bats, toads, hedgehogs, shrews, nightjars, grasshopper warblers, and stone-curlews. A hot June afternoon rounds it out with hedgerow and dune blooms, June beetles in roses, leafcutter bees fashioning brood cells, climbing bryony, showy ragwort and mullein feeders, and small passerines like tree pipit and whinchat\u2014set against the brood-parasitic cuckoo.

Expect cultural commentary, humorous asides, and keen-eyed descriptions rather than practical guidance or strict itinerary.  The opening of this travelogue sets sail from strike-tangled Tilbury on an under-staffed liner, moves past a nostalgic glimpse of Plymouth, and offers brisk, vivid stops\u2014Gibraltar in a blink, Naples in blazing color and song\u2014before coaling at Port Said amid conjurors and cookie-cutter fortune-tellers. Crossing the Red Sea\u2019s stifling heat (with a stoker\u2019s tragic leap), the narrator reads and reminisces\u2014Dumas, Hugo, Trollope\u2014then drifts into monsoon talk, ship-music, and brisk opinions about Australian sensitivities and travel criticism, even imagining an \u201cAustralian\u201d Chesterton. Ceylon appears in rickshaws, fans, and incomparable mangoes; later come a mock-dramatic authorial skit at sea, a ghost-story unmasked as a wayward figurehead, and a near-mishap leaving Fremantle. Adelaide prompts sharp notes on the hard lives and poor pay of merchant seamen; Melbourne flashes by; Sydney proves lively, its booksellers deft, and Andrew Lang is warmly remembered before transfer to a new ship bound for New Zealand.

{"76748": "\"On art and artists\" by Max Simon Nordau is a collection of art criticism essays written in the early 20th century. The work contends that art has an essential social mission, rejecting \u201cart for art\u2019s sake,\u201d and argues that modern, democratic societies need art that dignifies labor and expands the inner life stunted by specialization. It combines theory with incisive case studies\u2014from medieval French painters to modern sculptors and realists\u2014to show how art has served religion, power, and, increasingly, the public, while critiquing fashionable movements that mistake novelty for substance.  The opening of this work lays out a psychological and historical case against pure aestheticism: early art (from cave drawings to children\u2019s sketches) may spring from private impulse, but as civilization develops, artists address audiences, patrons, and social needs. The author surveys how ancient, medieval, and Renaissance art served gods, rulers, and institutions; how modern criticism and public exhibitions shifted authority to critics and the crowd; and why, in an industrial age of extreme specialization, art should restore wholeness and self-respect\u2014especially by ennobling work rather than wallowing in grim realism. He proposes \u201csocialistic art\u201d that arouses pity for the disinherited and reverence for honest labor, exemplified through vivid readings of Constantin Meunier\u2019s miners, smiths, and reapers (while noting a few missteps), and links this to Millet\u2019s moral gravity. A subsequent essay dissects style as the tension between construction (utility) and decoration (luxury), praising organic, meaning-rich ornament and critiquing mindless imitation and derivative \u201cSecessionist\u201d fashion. The opening then revisits medieval French masters, challenging the myth that French art merely copied Flemish or Italian models, highlighting naturalism in manuscript-derived painting, the greatness of Fouquet and the Master of Moulins, and the subtle, proto-revolutionary realism latent in sacred scenes, before turning to a century survey that begins to reassess eighteenth-century painters against the politics of taste.

{"76749": "\"Evolution made plain by John Mason\" is a concise popular science pamphlet written in the early 20th century. It is a scientific publication that introduces the theory of evolution in plain language, explaining how natural selection and other natural laws account for the development of all life, including humans.  The book defines what evolution is and is not, separates it from common misconceptions, and surveys geological time and the fossil record to show a progression from simple to complex forms. It marshals anatomical and embryological evidence (homologies, vestigial organs, and stages of development), discusses \u201cconnecting links,\u201d and compares humans and apes alongside early human fossils. It explains natural selection, variation, artificial selection, and the idea of mutations, then extends these ideas to social thought, urging free inquiry and tolerance while criticizing biblical literalism and popular objections. In its final sections it applies heredity and environment to human progress, argues for the primacy of the common good, and controversially advocates eugenic measures, calling for improved environments and responsible reproduction as the path to future advancement.

Expect lively social comedy, sharp character sketches, and probing questions about integrity, vanity, and how marriages are made.  The beginning of the novel alternates between Countess Muschi\u2019s breezy letters and Countess Paula\u2019s earnest memoirs. Muschi, bored at Sebenberg, sizes up a visiting Swabian suitor, spars with his pedantry, stages pranks and hunts, then deftly redirects his proposal to her demure friend Clara Aarheim\u2014securing their engagement while revealing her own restless standards. In contrast, Paula recalls a sheltered upbringing, a crisis of conscience that ended her enthusiasm for hunting, and a deepening intellectual life (sparked by Don Quixote) as her family steers her toward the proud Count Taxen. At soir\u00e9es she encounters the idealistic, unlucky Baron Schwarzburg, whose integrity captivates her, even as gossip swirls and her parents press the advantageous match with Taxen.

It examines the Leipzig region through landscape history, ecology, folklore, and monument care, with a clear conservationist outlook. Expect detailed pieces on the geological making of the Leipzig plain, the life and preservation of its floodplain forests, local customs, and the pressures of mining and urban growth, supported by photographs, maps, and field observations.  The opening of this volume presents editorial notes, publishing details, a contents overview, and a notice of a small exhibition, then moves into three substantial essays. Richard Buch traces the Leipzig land\u2019s formation from ancient variscan roots and Rotliegend volcanism through the Zechstein and Buntsandstein eras, the subtropical Tertiary with its brown coal, and the Ice Age that laid moraines, leveled plains, and created the fertile floodplains and Auenwald; he pairs geology with an advocate\u2019s eye for the plain\u2019s quiet beauty and notes modern scars from open-cast mining. Professor Naumann then portrays the Auwald west of Leipzig as a classic floodplain forest shaped by periodic inundation, detailing its tree mix (oak, ash, elm, hornbeam; willows and alders), undergrowth and rich spring flora, hydrology, and root ecology (including mycorrhiza), while highlighting protected zones like the Polenz at the Hundewasser and Luppe landscapes and warning against invasive plantings. Finally, Karl Berger defines \u201cLeipziger Land,\u201d voices concern over industrialization, suburban sprawl, and brown-coal works, and begins a walking sketch across the windswept fields north and west of the city (Rackwitz, Petersberg, the solitary Buschnaukirche), before the excerpt breaks off mid-journey.

{"76754": "\"Het paard : in zijne natuurlijke ontwikkeling\" by Wilhelm B\u00f6lsche is a popular scientific treatise written in the early 20th century. It explores the natural history and evolution of the horse, tracing its lineage from small, multi\u2011toed ancestors to the modern, single\u2011toed runner, and examines its close symbiosis with humans as a domesticated animal. Expect a blend of anatomy, paleontology, and behavioral insight that connects fossil evidence, comparative anatomy, and cultural history to explain what makes the horse unique.  The opening of this work sets out its purpose: to tell the full evolutionary story of the horse, beginning with tiny Eocene ancestors and linking them to living forms and domestic breeds. It recaps the rise of mammals from reptile\u2011like forebears through monotremes and marsupials to early placental groups, highlighting a pivotal Eocene fauna (the \u201cCernays\u201d forms) from which hoofed animals emerge. The text defines domestication as a lasting symbiosis rather than mere captivity, illustrating the idea with classic plant\u2013fungus and ant\u2013aphid partnerships before applying it to horses, dogs, and livestock. A clear, step\u2011by\u2011step anatomical comparison explains how the horse stands on a single middle toe, with splint bones as vestiges of lost digits, and how this design achieves speed, endurance, and load\u2011bearing. It then sketches the horse\u2019s instincts and signal\u2011sensitivity (including the \u201cClever Hans\u201d case) and turns to the fossil record, from Cuvier\u2019s early finds to the rich American deposits, noting that true horses once ranged widely in the Americas before disappearing there prior to European contact.

Aimed at school readers, it blends local history, geography, natural history, and legend to root learning in the islands themselves, drawing on Orcadian experts and illustrated extracts. Its core focus is Orkney\u2019s story from prehistory through the Norse earldom, alongside portraits of the landscape, wildlife, crafts, and lore that shape island identity.  The opening of the collection sets a proud, homesick tone with a poem to the \u201cSons of the Isles,\u201d then a preface stating its purpose: to begin knowledge at home, offer suggestive readings rather than exhaustive study, and acknowledge the many local contributors and patrons. A detailed contents map leads into brisk chapters on prehistoric Orkney\u2014flint tools, chambered cairns like Maeshowe, brochs, and standing stones\u2014followed by early glimpses in classical and church sources, Culdee traces in place-names, and the likelihood that Norse settlers met few inhabitants. It then explains the Viking world and the Sagas as key sources, and narrates the early earldom: Harald Fairhair\u2019s reach west, Sigurd the Mighty and Torf-Einar, a violent \u201cdark century,\u201d Olaf Tryggvason\u2019s forced conversion, and the battle of Clontarf.

It outlines native provincial divisions and the practical limits of Ottoman control, then surveys pre-Islamic civilisations (Min\u00e6an and Sab\u00e6an), the Marib dam and the Queen of Sheba, Abyssinian and Persian domination, the advent of Islam, and early pretenders. The account moves briskly through later dynasties, European trading forays, the first Ottoman occupation, the rise of the Qasimi Imams, Wahhabi incursions, and 19th-century Egyptian and Ottoman interventions that left the Imamate weakened and the coast in Turkish hands.

Raffles mounts an elaborate sting to expose the blackmailers, protect their victims, and simultaneously outmaneuver the ever-harried Inspector Baxter.

The opening of the book surveys lighthouses from antiquity\u2014the Pharos of Alexandria, Roman beacons at Dover, and early English pitch-pot signals\u2014through the rise of organized coastal lighting under Trinity House and the shortcomings of primitive fires and braziers. It then shifts to the Eddystone reef\u2019s location and danger, recounting Winstanley\u2019s ornate wooden tower swept away in a great storm, and Rudyerd\u2019s elegant timber-and-granite structure destroyed by fire. Enter Smeaton, who designs a heavier, all-stone, oak-trunk-shaped tower, houses a work crew on a nearby vessel, and builds with dovetailed granite, marble center plugs, iron cramps, and vaulted rooms\u2014culminating in a durable light that has stood against Atlantic gales. Interwoven are vivid set pieces: the hazards of working windows of calm, a near-fatal charcoal fume incident, and the triumphant lighting of the lantern. The section then begins Smeaton\u2019s life story\u2014his Yorkshire boyhood of mechanical tinkering, turn to instrument-making in London, methodical studies, Royal Society work, a learning trip to the Low Countries, and the persistent, weather-thwarted surveys that preceded construction\u2014establishing both the technical foundations and character that drive the narrative forward.

{"76769": "\"Oriole''s daughter, a novel, Volume 3 (of 3)\" by Jessie Fothergill is a novel written in the late 19th century. It follows Fulvia Marchmont, a Roman beauty trapped in a lavish but loveless marriage to a sickly millionaire in an English country house, as her bond with her austere protector Signor Oriole (her unacknowledged father) collides with a deepening love for the painter Hans Riemann. Moving between Yewridge Hall\u2019s staged opulence and haunting memories of Rome, it probes duty, reputation, and the price of freedom. Expect a cool, incisive social drama of endurance, temptation, and moral risk.  The opening of the book shows the Marchmonts installed at Yewridge Hall, where Fulvia maintains an impersonal poise while tending her suspicious, suffering husband and enduring sleepless nights. Society cautiously embraces her; she is admired yet distant, and she openly favors Hans\u2019s company, unsettling onlookers and her protective neighbor Minna Hastings, whose brother Richard reads the danger with cool clarity. As Marchmont\u2019s illness worsens and servants chafe, Fulvia meets Hans by a secluded lake; he urges elopement, she asks for three days, and Signor Oriole later warns her that Hans\u2019s character is unworthy, a judgment she rejects. When a specialist is summoned after a brutal attack, Fulvia, exhausted and resolute, plans to leave that very night after the consultation, while a moonlit coda shows Signor Oriole wakeful and Hans returning late, sullen and impatient.

{"76770": "Aspects of Jewish Power in the United States: Volume IV of The International Jew is a polemical collection of reprinted newspaper articles written in the early 20th century. It presents a conspiratorial, anti-Jewish account of alleged Jewish influence over American economic, political, and cultural life, framing this volume as further \u201cstudies\u201d from The Dearborn Independent. The focus ranges from claims about the liquor industry and Prohibition to broader assertions about labor, religion, education, and national identity.  The opening of the volume lays out a preface asserting that prior exposes have awakened public opinion, then lists chapters that target specific arenas of supposed Jewish power. It begins by alleging historic Jewish dominance of the liquor trade, arguing that \u201crectifiers\u201d degraded whiskey quality, helped spur Prohibition, and later orchestrated bootlegging\u2014naming lawyers, firms, and brands to claim a vast trust and distribution network. Subsequent chapters broaden the indictment, contending that rabbis\u2019 ritual-wine permits fueled illicit sales, and then shift to sweeping assertions about Jewish influence in labor movements, churches, and universities, portraying U.S. \u201cAmericanism\u201d as at odds with Jewish separateness. Throughout these opening sections, the text advances accusatory claims and lists of names to suggest coordinated control, setting a strident, propagandistic tone for the rest of the work.

{"76771": "\"A dissertation on the true age of the world : in which is determined the\u2026\" by Professor Wallace is a theological and chronological treatise written in the mid-19th century. It argues that the Septuagint\u2019s longer genealogical numbers, rather than the Masoretic Hebrew\u2019s shorter figures, preserve the authentic Biblical chronology from Creation to Christ, thereby lengthening the world\u2019s age by about fifteen centuries. Using Scripture, patristic testimony, early chronographers, and selective astronomical and geological reflections, it divides sacred history into six ages and seeks to fix key epochs such as the Flood, the Exodus, and the Advent. Readers should expect a rigorous defense of the Septuagint, critiques of Usher and other modern chronologers, and discussion of prophecy, cyclical time, and the millennium.  The opening of the treatise sets out the problem: large discrepancies between the Hebrew, Septuagint, and Samaritan texts in the antediluvian and postdiluvian genealogies, a long-debated issue now made urgent by geology, astronomy, and renewed interest in prophecy. The preface outlines two parts\u2014first, a critical reconstruction of Biblical chronology (leaning on Cuninghame and engaging Josephus, Eusebius, and others); second, an inquiry into primeval prophecy, idolatry\u2019s origins, and the \u201cseven ages,\u201d with hints of astronomical cycles (including a proposed grand planetary cycle) deferred to a future volume. The introduction notes the widespread expectation of a savior at the time of Christ and claims Scripture allows the epoch to be fixed, then sketches the authority and utility of the Septuagint over against the present Hebrew text. Early chapters present tables contrasting the three textual traditions, argue that the Hebrew and Samaritan numbers show deliberate centenary adjustments while the Septuagint\u2019s figures are internally coherent, defend the authenticity of the \u201csecond Cainan\u201d (citing Luke), and begin correcting received views on Terah and Abraham\u2014altogether preparing the case for the longer, Septuagint-based timeline.

{"76772": "\"Palaces and Prisons\" by Ann S. Stephens is a historical novel written in the late 19th century. Set on the eve of the French Revolution, it intertwines court intrigue and street-level hardship, following figures like Countess Du Barry, Marie Antoinette, Dr. Gosner, Count Mirabeau, and the humble yet determined Marguerite and her mother. The story promises a clash between glittering palaces and brutal prisons, as personal fates collide with rising popular unrest.  The opening of the novel contrasts the Grand Trianon\u2019s splendor with Parisian poverty. Du Barry imperiously presses the refined physician-seer Dr. Gosner to prolong the king\u2019s life and predict her future; he refuses, foresees her death on a blood-soaked scaffold, and reveals the ominous power of his Egyptian scarab ring. Enraged, she secures a lettre-de-cachet to send him to the Bastille and has her dwarf, Zamara, plant the ring as a \u201cgift\u201d for the Dauphiness, who innocently slips it on. The scene shifts to a garret where Gosner\u2019s starving wife and daughter, aided by the people\u2019s man Jacques, learn that Gosner is alive in the Bastille; they pledge themselves to the cause of liberty, encounter the magnetic Mirabeau, and\u2014through a kind market woman\u2014find Marguerite work selling flowers. It closes with the mother\u2019s renewed resolve, signaling her transformation from desperate petitioner to a woman ready to act. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76773": "\"Of the importance of religious opinions\" by Jacques Necker is a treatise of moral and political philosophy written in the late 18th century. It contends that religious belief is indispensable to public order and private happiness, countering efforts to ground morality solely in law, reason, or social esteem. The work promises wide scope\u2014from the social uses of worship and relations with sovereigns to arguments for God\u2019s existence, tolerance, and Christian morality.  The opening of the treatise presents a translator\u2019s note, a detailed table of contents, and an introduction in which the author, reflecting after public service, argues that administration, law, morality, and religion form one system whose harmony secures social prosperity. He laments fashionable indifference and sets himself between harsh intolerance and flippant unbelief, proposing to test whether a secular \u201cmoral catechism\u201d can replace religion. Chapter I asserts that basing virtue on the supposed union of private and public interest fails amid real social inequalities, limited education, and strong passions; laws reach actions but not intentions, whereas religion uniquely addresses imagination, conscience, youth, and the afflicted, offering simple, binding commands and hope beyond the present. At the start of Chapter II, he argues that civil and penal laws and public opinion cannot control hidden or ambiguous wrongs; only conscience, grounded in God, can, and even judges need both statute and inward moral responsibility, while reputation and public rewards are narrow, fallible incentives beside religion\u2019s universal, interior authority.

{"76774": "The future of an illusion by Sigmund Freud is a psychoanalytic treatise written in the early 20th century. It examines religion as a collective illusion born from human wishes and childhood helplessness, and considers how civilization might sustain social order without sacred authority. Blending psychology, cultural critique, and philosophy, it argues for replacing religious foundations with rational, scientific understanding.  The opening of the treatise defines culture as both the human conquest of nature and the regulation of social relations, stressing that it rests on labor, coercion, and instinctual renunciation that provoke resistance. It then turns to the \u201cpsychical\u201d supports of culture\u2014prohibitions and privations, their partial internalization as the super-ego, class grievances, the narcotic pride of cultural ideals, and the compensations of art\u2014culminating in religion as the most powerful device. Religion is presented as a projection of infantile helplessness and father-longing that humanizes nature, promises justice and an afterlife, and asserts authority without proof; these doctrines are labeled \u201cillusions\u201d grounded in wish-fulfilment rather than evidence. Anticipating objections that society would collapse without faith, the text counters that laws should be justified by social necessity, recasts religion as a universal obsessional neurosis with totemic roots, and urges \u201ceducation to reality\u201d and gradual reliance on reason and science, even while admitting the transition will be slow and contested.

{"76775": "\"Perte et gain :  histoire d''un converti\" by John Henry Newman is a novel written in the mid-19th century. It follows an Oxford undergraduate, Charles Reding, whose friendships, campus life, and theological debates draw him into a searching journey from Anglicanism toward a Catholic understanding. Cast against the ferment of the Oxford Movement, the story blends university satire with earnest spiritual inquiry through characters like the quick-witted Sheffield and the ritual-enthusiast Bateman.  The opening of the narrative sets the frame: the author insists it is not a polemic but a fictional portrait of a mind\u2019s progress, while the French translator\u2019s preface situates the work amid the Oxford Movement and praises its depiction of England\u2019s religious currents. The story then begins with Charles Reding, the sensitive son of an Anglican clergyman, educated at Eton and newly arrived at Oxford, where he befriends the brighter, more combative Sheffield. Their days include a visit with Bateman, a bachelier restoring a Gothic chapel, prompting lively talk about ritual forms\u2014piscinas, tabernacles, candles\u2014and whether such externals are meaningful or mere show, alongside banter about sermons, academic formalities, and Paley\u2019s evidences. A chance meeting with the seasoned fellow Malcolm adds a wry, insider view of Oxford fashions and religious agitation, suggesting that movements wax and wane even as Charles\u2019s inner questions quietly deepen.

{"76776": "\"Minor tactics of the chalk stream and kindred studies\" by G. E. M. Skues is a treatise on fly-fishing written in the early 20th century. It argues for the intelligent use of wet-fly methods on English chalk streams as a deliberate complement to the established dry-fly tradition. Blending observation, entomology, and fieldcraft, it offers practical tactics, patterns, and scenarios to help trout and grayling anglers widen their options without offending dry-fly ethics.  The opening of this treatise sets out Skues\u2019s purpose: to recover and modernize the wet-fly art for chalk streams, not to displace but to supplement Halfordian dry-fly practice. After a gracious second-edition note, he explains how personal encounters\u2014fish taking waterlogged or sunken flies, bulging trout on nymphs, and early mentors\u2019 accounts\u2014pushed him from orthodoxy toward upstream wet-fly experiments. He describes why trout regularly feed below the surface, outlines the three stages of a rise (nymphs, duns, then sub-surface leftovers), and defends fishing stages one and three with wet or nymphal imitations. He then offers clear guidance on handling bulging fish, reading subtle under-water takes, coping with rough light and wind, and details effective dressings and materials (soft hackles, dubbed bodies, and a handful of key patterns such as Greenwell\u2019s Glory, Tup\u2019s Indispensable, and Rough Olive). Brief case studies show the methods at work in glassy glides, eddies, moonlit currents, and tricky swims, plus notes on nymph imitation and the value of spinner patterns during dun hatches. The section closes with compact observations on hovering and cruising trout, the \u201cporpoise roll,\u201d choosing flies by a trout\u2019s position, and a cautionary anecdote about a famed, uncatchable bank-feeder finally taken by a sedge.

{"76777": "\"L''art de lire\" by \u00c9mile Faguet is a literary essay and practical guide to reading written in the early 20th century. It sets out how to read not as a critic on duty but as a cultivated reader seeking the fullest pleasure and understanding. Faguet argues for slow, attentive reading and tailored methods for different kinds of works\u2014philosophical, sentimental, and dramatic\u2014so that readers think better, feel more truly, and see more clearly.  The opening of the book contrasts reading to learn or to judge with reading for enjoyment, and declares the author\u2019s aim: to teach the art of pleasurable, intelligent reading. First comes a cardinal rule\u2014always read slowly, distrust first impressions, avoid skimming\u2014because slowness both deepens comprehension and immediately separates worthwhile books from the rest. For books of ideas, he recommends a continual back-and-forth comparison within the text to uncover an author\u2019s governing notions, their growth and contradictions, illustrating with Plato, Montesquieu, Descartes, and La Rochefoucauld; he frames this as a courteous intellectual fencing match that sharpens the reader\u2019s mind without dogmatism. For books of sentiment, he urges initial surrender to emotion, then a second phase of judgment grounded in real-life observation and self-analysis, with cautions about \u201cexceptional\u201d cases and a brisk portrait gallery of reader types (narrative-chasers, realists, idealists, poetry devotees, seekers of the exceptional, and classicists). Turning to drama, he defends reading plays as an appeal from the theater, and advises reading them as if staged\u2014seeing entrances, groupings, and gestures\u2014especially in Greek tragedy; a detailed example unpacks the physical action embedded in Racine\u2019s Ph\u00e8dre before the discussion moves toward Athalie.

{"76778": "\"Islam saharien :  chez ceux qui guettent (journal d''un t\u00e9moin)\" by Jean Pommerol is a nonfiction travel journal and ethnographic account written in the early 20th century. It explores Saharan Islam\u2014especially the Sufi confraternities (zaou\u00efas) and their political, social, and spiritual reach\u2014through a composite but observed narrative of a traveler taken in by a powerful order. Guided by a dubious escort and nursed by the taleb Si-Kaddour, the narrator encounters the rituals, discipline, and discreet authority of the Djazerti. The result is both first-hand reportage and a warning about the mobilizing force of religious networks across North and Central Africa.  The opening of the book sets out an \u201cAvertissement\u201d asserting the factual basis of the narrative while admitting that names like Mozafrane and the Djazerti are composites, then argues that French conquest unintentionally catalyzed the dramatic growth and politicization of Sufi orders. It sketches the evolution from early soufi asceticism to wealthy, far-reaching confraternities funded by alms, linked by zaou\u00efas, and capable of coordinated action\u2014illustrated by a brief account of the Margueritte uprising. The narrative then shifts to a desert journey: the narrator breaks his leg, follows the distant call to prayer, and, despite fears of hostility to \u201cRoumis,\u201d is solemnly received into a grand zaou\u00efa and placed under the care of Si-Kaddour and the servants. Convalescing, he experiences lavish hospitality, the silent daily visits of the white-robed saints, and intimate lessons where the taleb cites the Koran, tells the parable of the Three Barques, and outlines the strict rules for initiation and the binding obedience required of \u201cKhouan.\u201d These scenes prompt reflections on how small renunciations, ritual, and organization give the orders immense influence. The section closes with the narrator still confined to his room, observing and recording rather than roaming, aware he has yet to see the flow of pilgrims the place attracts.

It follows a spirited trio\u2014the unnamed narrator, Boy, and Bram\u2014through boozy student pranks, flirtations, and rambles from The Hague to Leiden and Scheveningen. With a breezy, wisecracking voice, it lampoons pompous types, charts Boy\u2019s tender pull toward Kitty, and revels in slapstick mishaps on land and sea.  The opening of the story frames everything as a playful fiction told in the first person, then briskly reveals outcomes (who marries whom) before rewinding to how the friends met. We see Boy\u2019s cheeky schoolroom rebellion, a headlong dash to the director, and an escalating run of antics that brings Bram literally tumbling into their lives on the dunes, a chaotic bar scene with the perpetually soused Dirk, and a comic train episode where an officious passenger is outwitted. A long, anarchic night in Leiden follows: borrowing trousers for Dirk, wrecking rooms with eggs and butter, a collapsed lamp and gas scare, a stolen trough of dough, and Boy\u2019s plunge into the Rapenburg, capped by a wary dawn and a failed attempt to get Dirk to a wedding. The pace then softens into club life at the Mafkolder\u2014teas, teasing, and rivalry with a bragging \u201ckatjang\u201d\u2014as Kitty quietly checks on Boy\u2019s character, and the pair finally confess mutual affection.

The return of Hilda\u2019s former admirer, Cave Charteris, stirs old feelings and new tensions amid talk of gambling, social standing, and hope for better fortunes.  The opening of this volume finds Hilda visiting the Baron\u2019s decayed ch\u00e2teau, where a broken Venetian glass, a tame wolf, and a dusty chapel with an organ reveal both faded grandeur and fragile pride. Hilda later secretly witnesses the Baron and Mr. Lovett gambling, receives a delicate Venetian vase from the Baron, and hears town gossip linking the flirtatious Miss Markham to a young spendthrift, Arthur Thrale.

{"76786": "\"A summer in Skye, Volume 1 (of 2)\" by Alexander Smith is a travelogue and reflective essay collection written in the mid-19th century. It traces a summer journey from Edinburgh through the Highlands and western lochs to the Isle of Skye, blending vivid nature writing with history, art, and social observation. Readers can expect lyrical landscapes, portraits of towns and people, and opinionated meditations on Scottish identity and culture.  The beginning of the book sets the narrator in heat-stricken Edinburgh, longing for escape and praising the restorative idleness of the Highlands while advocating light, simple travel. He sketches an expansive portrait of the city\u2014its literature and critics, Scott\u2019s outsized legacy, show-stopping beauty by day and night, the grandeur and squalor of the Old Town, intellectual pretensions (with barbed shots at Jeffrey), and the seasonal rhythms of art exhibitions and the General Assembly\u2019s pageantry. The tone is essayistic and digressive, moving from civic pride and social satire to the spiritual spell of the past that saturates Edinburgh\u2019s streets. The journey then unfolds: Stirling\u2019s views and the Wallace Monument spark reflections on nationality; Doune and its castle; Callander, the Pass of Leny, Loch Achray, and the Trosachs to Loch Katrine; on to Inversneyd and Loch Lomond, the \u201cCobbler,\u201d and the steep solitude of Glencroe; St Catherine\u2019s and a humorous coachman; Inverary and Duniquoich; Loch Awe, Kilchurn Castle, and Ben Cruachan; and the bustle and rain of Oban. A swift run up the Caledonian route brings Fort William (with a visit to the famed distiller \u201cLong John\u201d), Loch Ness, and Inverness, capped by a sunset reverie on Culloden Moor.

The narrator dwells on place, memory, and change, moving between scenic wonder and social observation.  The opening of this volume immerses the reader in Skye\u2019s antiquated atmosphere, then sketches the paternal, clanlike household of Mr M\u2019Ian\u2014a tacksman who keeps rent-free cotters, dispenses porch\u2011door justice, and binds the community through old obligations\u2014before contrasting him with \u201cthe Landlord,\u201d a wealthy, India-hardened reformer who manages tenants directly, runs a \u201cpenal\u201d crofting scheme on reclaimed \u201cblack land,\u201d and oversees a plain but purposeful school. A storm and flood frame the narrator\u2019s departure, leading to a vivid, stage-by-stage journey\u2014Isle Oronsay, Broadford, Sconser, Sligachan, Portree, Skeabost\u2019s island graveyard\u2014with a robust defense of the smoky Highland hut against urban misery. At the Landlord\u2019s, we see affectionate chaos of pets, Gaelic deputations, village visits, lev\u00e9es at turf walls, and the schoolroom\u2019s earnest geography and sums, all revealing a strict yet benevolent social experiment. The section closes with a drive toward Dunvegan via Orbost: legends at the Fairy Bridge, clan feuds (Trompon and Eigg), the sight of Macleod\u2019s Tables and Maidens, an incongruously modern house set in a haunting coastal landscape, and ruins that echo the clan\u2019s dwindling grandeur.

{"76788": "\"Round the Horn before the mast\" by Basil Lubbock is a maritime memoir written in the early 20th century. It follows a gentleman volunteer who ships before the mast on the four\u2011masted barque Royalshire to experience deep\u2011water life on a grain passage from San Francisco around Cape Horn toward Europe. The narrative dwells on the gritty work, seamanship, and shipboard culture of the great windjammers, painting vivid portraits of officers, crew, and ports. It promises realism, humor, and danger rather than romance.  The opening of this narrative finds the narrator in San Francisco after the Klondike, choosing the Royalshire, signing on, and pairing up with fellow recruit Don Henderson. He outfits like a common seaman and plunges into hard labor: unloading Japanese coal, scouring stringers and bilges, chipping and painting, wrestling wire moorings, and enduring rough fare\u2014relieved by cricket matches and the Seamen\u2019s Institute. The ship shifts to Oakland Creek and Port Costa to line the holds and load barley, while a suspicious Swedish sailmaker appears, a classic South Sea whaler is spotted, and the crew bends sail aloft in a stiff wind. There are swims in the Sacramento, a sandy-shore breakfast on a boat errand, and a grim episode when an apprentice from another ship drowns and the Royalshire\u2019s \u201cnipper\u201d is nearly lost. After finishing cargo and returning to the bay, a mixed crew drifts aboard, the narrator briefly serves as steward, and the harbor erupts in celebration for returning troops as the ship is dressed overall. Before dawn, the men man the capstan, a tug takes hold, the anchor breaks out, and the Royalshire heads to sea. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76789": "\"Oration on Voltaire by Victor Hugo and Julius Moritzen\" is a collection of an oration and critical essays compiled in the early 20th century. It presents a translated ceremonial address alongside an introduction and interpretive pieces that frame Voltaire\u2019s life and influence. The book is best described as a literary-historical tribute and critical study, focusing on Voltaire\u2019s fight against religious intolerance and judicial cruelty, and on his lasting role in shaping modern ideas of justice, tolerance, and peace.  The introduction hails progress as both evolution and revolt, praising Voltaire\u2019s liberation of conscience and condemning priestly and political tyranny. The central oration, delivered at the centennial of Voltaire\u2019s death, portrays him as an age-defining force who exposed infamous injustices like the Calas and La Barre cases, fought oppression with the pen, and joined compassion to reason, linking Gospel mercy with Enlightenment tolerance while denouncing war and calling for human concord. A biographical sketch then recounts his irreverent wit, the deathbed legends, and evidence that he died a steadfast skeptic, securing burial despite clerical resistance. The final section, drawing on Georg Brandes, places Voltaire in an international context: England\u2019s free speech shaped his liberalism; high society and statesmen opened doors; his unique exchange with Frederick the Great enriched both ruler and writer; his histories of Charles XII and Peter the Great broadened his reach; and his correspondence with Russian rulers, including Catherine II, shows his pan-European influence. It closes with a striking allegory of humanity\u2019s habit of persecuting its benefactors before erecting their statues. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76790": "Kurimus :  Runoja by Yrj\u00f6 Jylh\u00e4 is a collection of lyric poems written in the late 1920s. The book explores inner turmoil, eros and guilt, death and fate, and the tension between artistic ideals and everyday reality, using folk motifs, biblical and mythic figures, and flashes of modern urban life to probe moral conflict and longing.  The poems unfold in four movements: from childhood visions and a \u201cmetamorphosis\u201d into darker seas, to lullabies for a wayward heart, fatigue, exile, and the shattering of heroic dreams; then to sharp social satires of ideologies and literary cults; then to love lyrics and tales\u2014tenderness edged with cruelty, saxophone-bright travel reveries, St. George saving a princess, a shared quest toward a \u201cblue mountain,\u201d dreams of spring, and visitations by Death; and finally to a confessional descent where jealousy and lust speak plainly. The last part gathers stark scenes of obsession and violence, pleas and prayers that mix blasphemy with yearning, a beast within that cannot be gentled, and images of neon-lit nights, damning letters, and sailors burned by the sun who never truly return. Together the sequence sketches a soul wrestling with desire and conscience, reaching for grace while circling a fatal whirlpool. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76791": "\"Euthanasia :  or, Medical treatment in aid of an easy death by William Munk\" is a medical treatise from the Victorian era. It synthesizes clinical observation, ethical reflection, and practical bedside guidance to show how physicians and nurses can ease the final hours of the dying. The book argues that the act of dying is usually neither agonizing nor fearful, and urges the medical profession to study and practice an \u201ceasy death\u201d as part of its duty. Its likely topic is the phenomena, modes, and clinical management of dying, aimed at securing a calm, pain\u2011relieved, and dignified end.  The book is organized into three parts: first, it examines common experiences near death\u2014diminishing pain perception, patterns of delirium, the \u201clightening before death,\u201d and the persistence of hearing\u2014countering the myth of the \u201cdeath struggle.\u201d Next, it outlines the main modes of dying by failure of the heart (syncope or asthenia), lungs (asphyxia), or brain (coma or exhaustion), with the classic bedside signs such as the facies Hippocratica. Finally, it gives detailed, practical care: avoid force\u2011feeding; prefer milk, cream, eggs, and farinacea; use wine or brandy judiciously as stimulants; offer ice for thirst; stop fluids when swallowing fails. Opium (ideally as morphia) is the chief remedy for pain and the dreadful sinking at the chest, while ether, ammonia, and occasional turpentine help dyspnea and bronchial clogging; drugs should be few and purpose\u2011driven. Care of environment\u2014fresh cool air, adequate light, quiet ordinary voices (no whispering), few attendants\u2014plus posture and light coverings are emphasized, with specific measures for stertor, hiccup, and bladder distention. The closing guidance covers special scenarios (heart, lung, brain failure) and notes that in death from old age, gentle nursing usually suffices, as nature itself provides the perfect euthanasia.

{"76792": "\"Hurlothrumbo: or, The super-natural\" by Samuel Johnson is a satirical play written in the early 18th century. It is a delirious burlesque of gallantry, politics, and metaphysics, told in bombastic speeches, songs, and visions. The story orbits a lovestruck King, the extravagant champion Hurlothrumbo, the steadfast Theorbeo, the scheming Darony and Urlandenny, and the mercurial Lord Flame, as courtly passion collides with rebellion and celestial pageantry.  The opening of the play presents mock-heroic dedications and a prologue that exalts unfettered imagination, then plunges into a court where a King pines for the Spanish princess Cademore while conspirators quietly convert their estates into war chests. Visionary \u201cSolitaries\u201d warn of danger; Hurlothrumbo boasts of slaying a lion; and Lord Flame raves in jealous love. As Theorbeo pledges loyalty, Darony and Urlandenny spark a nocturnal uprising, enlist a Dutch general, and seize the city, leading to the King\u2019s imprisonment and Cademore\u2019s distress. Theorbeo engineers the King\u2019s escape by trading clothes, while Dologodelmo laments Hurlothrumbo\u2019s betrayal, and allegorical figures like Genius and Death stalk the battlefield. A forced wedding is disrupted, the King rallies his smaller force in a frenzy of mock-epic imagery, and victory swings his way; the court scenes that follow turn toward petitions and the testing of mercy, setting up the play\u2019s blend of satire, spectacle, and sudden clemency.

{"76793": "\"Marcela, o \u00bfa cu\u00e1l de los tres? : Comedia original en tres actos\" by Don Manuel Bret\u00f3n de los Herreros is a comedic play written in the early 19th century. It\u2019s a sparkling social satire set in Madrid, where the witty young widow Marcela is courted by three very different men\u2014an ardent but shy poet (Don Amadeo), a boastful artillery captain (Don Mart\u00edn), and a foppish dandy (Don Agapito)\u2014while her loquacious uncle and sharp-tongued maid complicate the game. The likely focus is a battle of manners, ego, and sincerity as Marcela weighs charm, substance, and freedom in choosing \u201cwhich of the three.\u201d  The opening of the play sets the tone with rapid-fire banter and comic contrasts inside Marcela\u2019s home. Don Timoteo bickers with the maid over his treasured nativity figures, while Don Agapito flatters Marcela with sweets and airs; Don Amadeo arrives to pine in verse and begs Juliana\u2019s help; and Don Mart\u00edn bursts in, swaggering and talkative. After a garden stroll and a shared meal, Agapito tries to extract a \u201cte quiero,\u201d but Marcela cleverly sends him away for confections and privately coaxes Amadeo\u2019s feelings from a timid letrilla, only for Mart\u00edn to interrupt with a loud declaration that is itself cut short by the household sensation: the cat Clitemnestra has given birth. Soon after, Amadeo and Mart\u00edn agree to compete openly for Marcela and to thwart Agapito. At the start of the third act, Timoteo urges Marcela to remarry (hinting at Mart\u00edn), and Marcela receives three written proposals: Agapito\u2019s syrupy letter, Amadeo\u2019s humble sonnet, and Mart\u00edn\u2019s bluntly comic plea; undecided, she summons them all to return later for her answer.

{"76794": "\"Lalla Rookh :  An Oriental romance\" by Thomas Moore is a narrative poem written in the early 19th century. It frames a sequence of romantic, exotic tales within the journey of Princess Lalla Rookh to meet her betrothed, accompanied by a young Kashmiri minstrel, Feramorz, under the watchful eye of the censorious courtier Fadladeen. The work blends love, illusion, zeal, and power against a richly imagined Mughal\u2013Persian backdrop.  The opening of the work sets Lalla Rookh\u2019s lavish departure from Delhi for Cashmere, then introduces Feramorz, who begins the tale \u201cThe Veiled Prophet of Khorassan.\u201d In that story, the charismatic impostor Mokanna courts followers with promises of freedom; the idealistic youth Azim joins him, while Zelica\u2014Azim\u2019s former beloved, driven half-mad by rumors of his death\u2014has been ensnared as the Prophet\u2019s priestess and bound by a terrible oath. Forced to become a temptress for Mokanna\u2019s designs, she recoils at his blasphemy, and when he lifts his veil she collapses in horror. Returning to the frame, the Princess hurries past illuminations to hear more; the tale resumes with Azim wandering a sumptuous haram, resisting seductive pageantry as he thinks of Zelica, until one trembling, unveiled nymph remains before him.

{"76795": "The origin and development of the atomic theory by Maynard Shipley is a scientific publication and historical account written in the early 20th century. The book concisely traces how ideas about atoms arose, changed, and matured\u2014from ancient philosophical speculations to modern scientific theories\u2014showing how the concept of matter\u2019s discreteness evolved into the foundation of chemistry and physics.  Shipley begins with the Pythagoreans, Philolaus, and related ideas from India, highlighting number, geometry, and the five regular solids as early ways to picture particles. He then presents Leucippus and Democritus: atoms and void, causal necessity, subjective sense qualities, and the role of shape, size, and arrangement; along the way he contrasts them with the Eleatics\u2019 denial of motion and Anaxagoras\u2019 \u201cseeds.\u201d The narrative turns to Epicurus and Lucretius, covering equal falling speeds in the void, the swerve debate, many worlds, and a polemic against superstition and divine design. Democritus\u2019 \u201csoul atoms,\u201d effluences, and theories of color and taste are explained alongside Aristotle\u2019s critiques. The closing chapter follows post-classical atomism through Descartes and Gassendi to Dalton\u2019s laws of definite and multiple proportions, clarifying early errors about formulas, and connects these to modern insights\u2014electrons, nuclei, isotopes, and atomic number\u2014showing how an ancient idea became the quantitative science of matter.

The story follows young doctor Humphrey Jardine as he stumbles into a baffling mystery in Hampstead\u2014first a vanished corpse and then a calculated attempt on his own life\u2014before the renowned medical jurist Dr. John Thorndyke is drawn in. Expect an intricate, scientifically grounded investigation involving forensic clues, a strange reliquary, and unsettling encounters in London\u2019s lanes and lodgings.  The opening of the novel finds Jardine discovering, on a rainy midnight walk through Millfield Lane, what appears to be the body of an elderly clergyman\u2014only for it to vanish before he can return with the police. Next day he uncovers a bloodstain on a fence, footprint traces into Ken Wood, and a small octagonal gold reliquary marked with initials, but the authorities are sceptical.

{"76797": "\"Etsij\u00e4in seura\" by G. Lowes Dickinson is a political-philosophical dialogue written in the early 20th century. It presents a fictional club of \u201cseekers\u201d whose members\u2014public men, scientists, and artists\u2014debate the nature of society and the state. Key voices include Lord Cantilupe the Tory traditionalist, Alfred Remenham the eloquent Liberal, Reuben Mendoza the hard-headed Conservative, and George Allison the pragmatic Socialist, each setting out a personal credo. The likely topic is a searching, idea-driven clash over hierarchy, democracy, free trade, empire, and socialism, staged as a civil yet pointed symposium.  The opening of this work introduces the club, the host-narrator\u2019s country-house setting, and the device of \u201cpersonal confessions\u201d when Cantilupe arrives without a paper. Cantilupe defends inherited hierarchy, the gentleman-gentry state, skepticism of democracy and free trade, and a rooted rural order, explaining his retreat from politics. Remenham answers with a confident liberal credo\u2014trust in popular sovereignty and change, institutions that grow with social forces, and free trade as nature\u2019s exchange, culminating in a cosmopolitan \u201cparliament of man.\u201d Mendoza replies with sardonic realism, questioning pure freedom, praising cautious, empirical governance, prioritizing national strength, and foreseeing imperial federation rather than universal peace, before calling a reflective truce. The spell is broken when Allison begins a brisk socialist case for gradual, technocratic transformation via taxation, public ownership, and expert administration, extending to science, art, and religion under state guidance.

{"76798": "\"Tulia y.m. kuvauksia\" by Iivo H\u00e4rk\u00f6nen is a collection of literary sketches and stories written in the early 20th century. The work paints intimate, folkloric portraits of Karelian village life\u2014its rites of passage, ancestral memory, hard work, and song\u2014through vivid scenes and emblematic figures. Central vignettes follow Palakia from birth and courtship to marriage, honor village singers and blacksmiths, and celebrate runo traditions that bind a community to its past and to nature.  The opening of the collection moves from a nightscape of scattered fires that symbolically trace a human life\u2014from birth sauna to wedding bonfires and the final funeral candle\u2014to a meditative walk in a Karelian grave grove where the whispering spruces awaken voices of the ancestors. It then settles into the tale of Palakia: her hard-won christening, upbringing under the song-rich guidance of Ontro-vaari, learning the forest\u2019s language as a cowherd, a near-loss in the woods, and a tender courtship with Niemen Iivana that leads to vibrant village weddings and a quietly radiant married life. A forge scene follows, where a blacksmith\u2019s monologue turns the paja into a \u201ctemple of work,\u201d extolling fire, patience, and endurance. Finally, a runo singer, \u00c4im\u00e4j\u00e4rven Iivana, dreams of a hill becoming a chorus of kantele, is invited to a grand festival, and journeys with fellow singers through Sortavala and Viipuri to Helsinki, where their epic songs and women\u2019s laments move audiences in a national celebration of folk music.

An editor\u2019s framing introduction situates her life and underscores the cultural value of letter-writing, while portraits and notes enrich the social backdrop.  The opening of the collection provides an editorial portrait of Eliza\u2019s family origins in Scarborough, Maine; her schooling near Boston; her bright debut into society; her marriage to Walter Bowne; and her early death after a southern voyage, presented as a case for the vividness of letters. It then shifts to her earliest surviving letters from boarding school, where she reports crowded sleeping quarters, lessons in arithmetic and geometry, the prospect of French and dancing, and housework routines, all while appealing to her parents for more study and supplies. Subsequent notes from Boston and home mix theater and assembly-going with requests for bonnets, wigs, and gowns, news of siblings\u2019 illnesses, and affectionate household management. The correspondence also starts to show her thoughtful voice\u2014critiquing a severe teacher, defending her reputation, and debating with a cousin about women\u2019s education, love, marriage, and social expectations\u2014against a lively backdrop of visits, partners at balls, and encounters with prominent New England families.

Set at the prep school of Wyndham, it follows three friends\u2014Clif Bingham, Tom Kemble, and the wheelchair-using Loring Deane\u2014through a season that pivots from a fierce hockey rivalry with Wolcott to the trials of making the baseball team. The focus is on teamwork, perseverance, and school spirit, with coaches, tryouts, and friendships shaping the boys\u2019 fortunes on and off the field.  The opening of the novel plunges into a tied hockey finale against Wolcott, where substitute wing Clif is sent in, shadows the star Houston, and scrambles in the winning goal. It then introduces the \u201cTriumvirate\u201d\u2014Clif, brash Tom, and bright, resilient Loring (assisted by his dignified attendant, Wattles)\u2014and shifts to early baseball preparations: Coach Connover and Captain Hurry Leland set standards, a tough schedule looms, and indoor drills give way to chilly outdoor work.

{"76801": "\"An atlas of gas poisoning by Great Britain. Medical Research Committee\" is a scientific medical atlas produced in the World War I era. It presents official, instructional illustrations and notes for medical officers on the effects of chemical warfare agents, focusing on phosgene and mustard gas. The likely topic is the pathology, clinical presentation, and practical implications of gas injuries to the lungs, skin, airways, and eyes.  The book explains that phosgene, a pulmonary irritant, causes immediate respiratory discomfort followed by delayed but rapidly progressive lung oedema, alveolar rupture, vascular congestion, and small-vessel thrombosis, leading to \u201cblue\u201d or \u201cpallid\u201d asphyxia and early death in severe cases; brief case notes and a lung micrograph demonstrate these changes, with mention of oxygen and venesection as supportive measures. Mustard gas, a vesicant, acts with delayed onset, producing intense conjunctivitis, diffuse skin erythema, blistering, and later brown staining, with particular vulnerability of moist skin areas and the perineum; in the airways it causes sloughing of tracheal and bronchial mucosa, secondary infection, and septic broncho\u2011pneumonia, while lung sections show bronchiolar necrosis and peribronchial haemorrhage rather than generalised oedema. The atlas also stages ocular burns from acute damage to resolution, noting risks of corneal ulceration and outlining supportive care (early atropine and cleansing, later astringents). Throughout, concise plate descriptions, case sketches, and histology highlight the distinct mechanisms, timelines, complications, and recovery patterns of these two agents.

Expect a broad mix of realist, urban, war, folk, and regional tales\u2014including pieces like The Killers and The Scarlet Woman\u2014alongside commentary that frames their themes and craft.  The opening of the anthology presents acknowledgments, a contents list, and Blanche Colton Williams\u2019s introduction detailing the judges, how hundreds of stories were narrowed to the final fifteen, and which entries won top honors (Child of God first, The Killers second, The Scarlet Woman as best short short). Williams surveys themes\u2014especially depictions of Black life, terse realism, and vivid settings\u2014and supplies extensive ranked lists of notable stories and magazines. The first selection then begins: in Child of God, Willie Malone, a Black man condemned for killing a white landowner after a dispute over hogs, faces his hanging with calm faith, friendly banter with the jailer, and a desire to make a final speech; after the trap drops, he imagines a lavish heavenly journey (Gabriel\u2019s trumpet, St. Peter, Little David\u2019s harp, a kindly scarred angel) and tells the Great Lord God he was denied his speech, whereupon he\u2019s sent back to the jail to deliver it\u2014unseen as officials settle paperwork and the scene cuts off.

{"76803": "\"Regeneration: A Reply to Max Nordau\" by A. Egmont Hake is a polemical work of cultural criticism written in the late 19th century. It rebuts Max Nordau\u2019s Degeneration, arguing that modern art, literature, and music are not pathological signs but expressions of renewal, imagination, and ethical striving. The treatise challenges the misuse of \u201cscientific\u201d diagnosis in aesthetics, defends mysticism and symbolism, and situates cultural change within social realities like poverty, militarism, and press sensationalism.  The opening of the work sets the stage with Nicholas Murray Butler\u2019s introduction, which dismantles Nordau\u2019s melodramatic attack on modern culture and his credulous use of alienist \u201cscience,\u201d urging fair standards and reminding readers of the steady moral and intellectual gains among \u201cthe plain people.\u201d Hake then begins by interrogating the critic himself: he shows how judgments of an era are distorted by specialization and bias, and he reads Nordau through lenses of German deference to authority, anti-French sentiment, Jewish free\u2011thinker pragmatism, and \u201cscientific superstition.\u201d In the next section he contests Nordau\u2019s claim that only elites are \u201cdegenerating,\u201d noting that masses and classes mirror each other, that the real corruptor is systemic misery (especially poverty), and that citing eccentric fashions, beards, or d\u00e9cor as proofs of decline is absurd; unrest, he argues, is a sign of coming renewal, not decay. He then defends mysticism, imagination, and symbolic art as sane and necessary to human feeling, upholds the legitimacy of pre\u2011Raphaelite aims (while separating them from camp followers), corrects Nordau\u2019s misreadings (e.g., of Millais and Holman Hunt), and highlights the limits of materialist science and the emotive power of music and visual art to convey meaning beyond strict logic.

The tale follows a young Texas Ranger known as Ware\u2019s Kid as he hunts the suspected killer of a ranch partner in the border country, blending pursuit, frontier justice, and moral ambiguity against a stark desert backdrop.  The story opens with Ware\u2019s Kid in Dallas, where a barroom dustup proves his mettle before he teams with deputy Bos\u2019 Johnson to interrupt a Sam Bass train robbery at Mesquite. Wounded in the fight, the Ranger discovers Johnson is actually Dell Spreen, the man accused of murdering Eph Carson; yet Spreen saves his life and swears he\u2019s innocent.

{"76805": "\"Life of George Washington, volume 2 of 5\" by Washington Irving is a historical biography written in the mid-19th century. This volume centers on Washington\u2019s early leadership of the Continental Army, charting the siege of Boston, the fraught Canadian venture, and the opening New York\u2013New Jersey campaigns. It highlights battlefield decisions, supply and discipline challenges, and vivid portraits of both American and British commanders, revealing how Washington forged an army under pressure.  The opening of the volume follows Washington\u2019s arrival at Cambridge to take command, his survey of British leaders (Howe, Clinton, Burgoyne), and a stark contrast between well-ordered British lines and a raw, sprawling American force short on men, engineers, and supplies. Irving sketches the camp\u2019s personalities and organization\u2014Putnam\u2019s energy, Greene\u2019s promise, Gates\u2019s role, Lee\u2019s harsh discipline and irreverence, and Washington\u2019s close reliance on Joseph Reed\u2014while describing reforms in logistics and fortifications and the arrival of frontier riflemen under Daniel Morgan. Washington refuses to scatter his army along the coast, articulates a clear policy for defending the whole, and, amid efforts to provoke a British sortie at Boston, grapples with a near-ruinous powder shortage and asserts the dignity of the patriot cause in a firm exchange with General Gage over prisoner treatment. Parallel chapters trace turmoil on the northern frontier\u2014Allen and Arnold\u2019s rivalry after Ticonderoga, Congress\u2019s legitimizing steps, Schuyler and Montgomery\u2019s preparations, Indian diplomacy at Cambridge, and the conception of a bold overland thrust toward Quebec\u2014culminating in Schuyler\u2019s small force pushing to the Isle aux Noix and Washington\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to draw the British out by seizing a forward hill near Charlestown Neck.

{"76806": "\"The law of copyright by William Wordsworth\" is a short open letter and pamphlet on copyright law written in the early Victorian era. It advocates reform of literary property, supporting a parliamentary effort to extend authors\u2019 rights and arguing that writers hold an enduring property interest in their works.  An editor\u2019s note frames the piece as a newspaper letter backing Serjeant Talfourd\u2019s bill and explains its later rediscovery. The main text is a dignified appeal from Rydal Mount: the poet declines to organize a petition, believing Parliament should recognize the obvious justice of the cause, but publicly declares firm support for longer protection. He criticizes the opposition from printers and publishers, asserts that common law upholds an author\u2019s perpetual property, and rejects comparisons between literature and patentable inventions. Speaking for the whole class of writers\u2014and mindful of heirs\u2014he urges restoration of their rights and closes with confidence that justice will ultimately prevail and gratitude to those advancing the reform.

The beginning of the novel shows Denise daydreaming on a spring day, mimicking a wood-thrush and chatting to her pony before rescuing a muddy, howling child whose muddled name turns out to be Mabel Lilly Taintit. Denise celebrates her old goat Tan\u2019s \u201cbirthday,\u201d then meets Hart Murray, who becomes her fast friend; their play with the pets leads to Ned\u2019s notorious prank of dumping Hart in a cow yard. We see Denise\u2019s \u201csunset hour\u201d with her wise mother, including a lesson in courtesy about postponing plans, followed by the cheerful christening and launch of Hart\u2019s cedar rowboat, the River Kelpie. Pokey arrives for summer, a circus comes to town, and Ned\u2019s high spirits carry the girls right into the parade before the family sets out together to see the show.

{"76808": "\"A sailor''s life under four sovereigns, Volume 1 (of 3)\" by Sir Henry Keppel is a naval memoir written in the late 19th century. It recounts the author\u2019s early life and long Royal Navy career, blending lively anecdote with first-hand glimpses of global cruising, naval culture, and political events. Expect portraits of ships, shipmates, and admirals; scenes from Madeira to Rio, the West Indies, Mexico, and back; and encounters with figures like Lord Cochrane amid Brazilian independence. The tone is brisk, humorous, and observant, with an eye for both seamanship and society.  The opening of the memoir traces Keppel from a perilous infancy and mischievous schooldays in Norfolk to the Royal Naval College and his first commission. He sketches a Whig-tinged family circle at Holkham, processions for Sir Francis Burdett, a tour to Newstead with the Duke of Sussex, Nelson connections, and the rituals and rough fun of cadet life before joining HMS Tweed. The narrative then shifts to sea: voyages to Madeira, Rio, Bahia, and Pernambuco during Brazil\u2019s upheavals, a meeting with Lord Cochrane, and the dramatic refuge of a fleeing Pernambuco leader on board. Further chapters cover River Plate calls and light-hearted midshipmen exploits, a winter run to Halifax with a bishop, West India cruising, Tampico and Vera Cruz (including an alligator episode), Havana, Port Royal, a captured slaver, and an inland visit to Xalapa. It closes this opening stretch with the Tweed\u2019s 1827 recommission under Lord John Churchill, a near-miss with the Navarino campaign, and a fresh outward passage via Madeira and the Cape Verdes.

{"76809": "\"A sailor''s life under four sovereigns, Volume 2 (of 3)\" by Sir Henry Keppel is a naval memoir written in the late 19th century. It presents first-hand campaigning, travel, and diary-like observations from a senior Royal Navy officer, with a strong focus on anti-piracy operations in Borneo and later postings across the globe. Expect riverine warfare, alliances with local leaders such as Rajah Brooke, vivid shipboard life, and social vignettes from ports and drawing rooms alike.  The opening of the volume plunges into Keppel\u2019s 1844 Sarawak campaigns with HMS Dido and the steamer Phlegethon: a swift assault on Patusen\u2019s forts, the destruction of pirate strongholds, and a pursuit upriver that topples Seriff Muller\u2019s base. A rash encounter near a Dyak hill-village costs the life of the energetic First Lieutenant Wade, and a brutal m\u00eal\u00e9e at Karangan brings heavy losses, including the renowned Patingi Ali and Mr. Steward, before the position is carried; throughout, civilians are spared and fugitives aided, while Seriff Sahib is driven into flight. The narrative then shifts to the homeward voyage\u2014storm drama off the Cape, a comic ruse to visit his wife before orders, and paying off the Dido\u2014before settling into dated diary entries of peacetime: publishing the Borneo expedition, levees, hunting and races, studying steam at Woolwich, and lobbying for British footholds such as Labuan.

{"76810": "\"A sailor''s life under four sovereigns, Volume 3 (of 3)\" by Sir Henry Keppel is a naval memoir written in the late 19th century. This concluding volume follows Keppel\u2019s later career across Asia and Africa\u2014combat on China\u2019s rivers, visits to Sarawak, anti-slavery patrols off East Africa, big-game interludes, and service at Court\u2014told in brisk, anecdotal entries that blend operations, travel, and high society.  The opening of the volume plunges into Keppel\u2019s firsthand account of the Fatshan Creek action, where his boat is sunk under heavy fire before a renewed assault scatters and captures most of a Chinese junk fleet; he includes a captured proclamation from Admiral Yeh and memorializes fallen and wounded comrades. The narrative then shifts into journal-like notes: a court-martial after the loss of Raleigh, reassignment and movements on the Canton River, a detour to Sarawak with Brooke\u2019s circle and jungle excursions, and onward travel through Singapore and India amid news of honors. Returning to England, Keppel records a whirl of hunting and society, a deft recovery of a stolen officer\u2019s watch, and his first turns as Groom-in-Waiting at Osborne and Windsor with lively court vignettes. He next takes the Cape command in HMS Forte, carries Sir George Grey via Madeira and Rio, shifts to HMS Brisk for an East African cruise that includes edging into Delagoa Bay, a moonlit turtle foray at Europa Island, the seizure of the slaver Manuela, hippopotamus shooting near Zanzibar, and a return to Mauritius to rehoist his flag and stage a mock landing operation.

{"76811": "\"Crash dive by Claude C. Vickrey\" is a naval adventure short story written in the late 1920s. It portrays a submarine training exercise that turns into a perilous emergency, focusing on seamanship, technical failure, and the crew\u2019s ingenuity under extreme pressure.  A young submarine officer narrates his first crash dive, where a cascading series of small errors culminates in the chief forgetting to shut the main induction valve. Flooding drives the boat to the bottom in mud at about one hundred thirty feet with the bow steeply down, trapping the crew and threatening them with dwindling air and chlorine gas from compromised batteries. Realizing they cannot pump out the water, the officers gamble on forcing the stern to the surface: they blow out fuel, oil, and fresh water, shift every movable weight forward, and work hand pumps in darkness as morale frays. After grueling hours they heel the submarine to roughly seventy-eight degrees, chisel through the exposed stern plating, and raise a makeshift distress flag. A Coast Guard destroyer spots the signal and rescues the exhausted men, capping the ordeal with the captain\u2019s dry reply to a command query: \u201cPosition Vertical!\u201d (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}

Set around Lake Seneca, it follows determined youth Dean Mercer as he breaks from a law apprenticeship to launch a rival steamboat line with the backing of Judge Oglesby, while facing sabotage and scheming from entrenched interests. Allies like the salty Jack Carboy aid him, as bullies Tim Downey and Rodney Darringford plot theft, fraud, and arson; a parallel thread involves Dean helping Marcus Ellison in the fight to clear Marcus\u2019s father of a wrongful charge.  The opening of the story shows Dean quitting the musty law office, rescuing newcomer Marcus from a beating, and accepting two critical errands: safeguarding papers and money to aid Marcus\u2019s father, and carrying an $8,000 check to pay for the new steamer, the Spray. After Tim Downey overhears these plans, he alerts Rodney and Colonel Darringford, the Warrior sails early, and Dean and Jack chase it by stage\u2014surviving a crash\u2014then reboard at Landlock.

Expect brisk soldierly realism, sharp drawing-room tensions, and a quietly forming love triangle pressed by the threat of war.  The opening of the novel paints Camp Sandy in blistering heat, introducing the disciplined, reserved Truscott; the warm-hearted, wealthy Glenham; and the talkative, factional garrison community awaiting the arrival of Colonel Pelham\u2019s wife and the much-admired Grace.

{"76814": "\"Ghosts in the Great War, and true tales of haunted houses : Thrilling\u2026.\" by S. Louis Giraud is a collection of first-person ghost accounts written in the early 20th century. Drawn from readers of the Daily News, it gathers wartime apparitions, premonitions, and domestic hauntings, framed as \u201ctrue\u201d experiences rather than folklore. The tone is investigative rather than sensational, balancing believers\u2019 testimonies with skeptical letters and editor\u2019s notes about method and selection.  The opening of the collection sets out its newspaper origins: a public call for sober, first-hand reports, prizes for publishable accounts, and an editorial promise to classify, trim excess, and avoid lurid fabrications, while not claiming to prove or disprove ghosts. Several letters argue against superstition and offer psychological or scientific explanations, yet the main section, \u201cGhosts in the Great War,\u201d quickly unfolds dozens of brief, vivid vignettes\u2014soldiers guided from danger by dead comrades, loved ones appearing at the hour of death, mothers and fianc\u00e9es sensing wounds or peril, strange battlefield lights and vanishing figures, and uncanny warnings that avert disaster. These tales stress visions that coincide with verifiable events, \u201cinstinct\u201d that saves lives, and meaningful coincidences across distance. The excerpt then shifts to \u201cTrue Tales of Haunted Houses,\u201d beginning with an oppressive hotel presence that induces paralyzing dread, a recurring apparition of a tormented nun in a former monastic house, a farm rumored to be cursed and plagued by knocks and a grim old woman, a \u201cthimble-tapping\u201d matron who haunts a city bedroom, and a minister\u2019s family beset by varied rural spectres. It closes mid-anecdote as a narrator, fetching a book in darkness, senses a presence on the stairs. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76815": "\"A devil of a fellow, and The yellow cat by Wilbur Daniel Steele\" is a collection of short stories written in the early 20th century.

In \u201cA Devil of a Fellow,\u201d the swaggering fisherman Tony Va Di returns to his Cape town after months presumed dead to find his old flame, Mamie, hastily married to an aging shopkeeper who has just drowned. Through a night of labor, town gossip, and his own jealousy, Tony is forced into tenderness; the baby Mamie bears plainly favors him, and his bravado softens into a grudging acceptance of love and responsibility. \u201cThe Yellow Cat\u201d follows a narrator visiting an abandoned schooner brought in by his shaken friend McCord, who blames eerie happenings on a silent yellow cat. A hidden log hints at crew paranoia about a Chinese cook; a sailor vanishes; and, with the cat as their clue, they find the cook\u2019s stash and papers concealed in the foretopsail before he slips away into the river. The sea \u201cmystery\u201d resolves into human fear, prejudice, and nerve, with the cat merely a catalyst for men undone by isolation. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76816": "\"The great Roxhythe\" by Georgette Heyer is a historical novel written in the early 20th century. Set amid Restoration politics, it follows the charismatic yet enigmatic Marquis of Roxhythe\u2014favorite of King Charles II\u2014on a covert mission to court William of Orange, with a keen young secretary, Christopher Dart, drawn into espionage and statecraft.

{"76817": "\"Disease in captive wild mammals and birds :  incidence, description, comparison.\" by Herbert Fox, M.D. is a scientific monograph written in the early 20th century. It compiles systematic autopsies of zoo-kept mammals and birds to measure how often diseases occur, describe their pathology, and compare patterns across taxonomic orders, with practical guidance for zoo medicine, husbandry, and comparative pathology.  The opening of the volume presents a foreword describing the Philadelphia Zoological Garden\u2019s routine postmortems since the early 1900s and their dividends\u2014improved hygiene and disinfection, halted outbreaks, and dramatic reductions in tuberculosis in monkeys and spiropteriasis in parrots\u2014while reflecting on disease in wild versus captive settings and on captivity\u2019s stresses (diet, climate, fear, boredom, loneliness, reproductive challenges). The Introduction sets the scope and method: thousands of standardized autopsies organized by order to track incidence and describe lesions, alongside candid limits of clinical diagnosis and the cautions of extrapolating captive data to the wild. It surveys management factors (diet and vitamins, housing and temperature, flooring), the roles of parasites and epizootics, key differences in avian versus mammalian inflammatory responses, and broad longevity patterns, and it acknowledges the laboratory team and the taxonomic framework. The section closes with classification and autopsy counts and begins the heart-disease chapter, outlining how degenerations, inflammations, and enlargement (muscle bulk versus chamber size) will be compared across taxa.

{"76818": "\"The penny magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, issue\u2026\" by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge is a popular educational periodical written in the early 19th century. It presents a wide-ranging miscellany designed to spread practical and improving information\u2014natural history, geography, industry and commerce, agriculture, biography, moral essays, and household guidance\u2014to a general readership.  This issue opens with a striking description of the Natural Bridge of Virginia and related rock bridges in South America, then turns to clear, data-rich \u201cStatistical Notes\u201d on English and Welsh agriculture, covering corn-laws, price fluctuations, enclosures, farm sizes and leases, costs of cultivation, livestock and wool, and the scope for improvement. A witty anecdote about a Parisian shoeblack\u2019s enterprising poodle lightens the tone before a substantial feature on mahogany traces the wood\u2019s rise in British homes and details the arduous Honduran cycle of felling, road-cutting, trucking by oxen, river-floating, rafting, and export. Short essays define education in its professional, civic, and religious dimensions; argue that diligence outworks mere talent; and show how to learn geography by reading landforms first, since hills shape rivers, towns, minerals, and livelihoods. A weekly column sketches John Wesley\u2019s tireless life and notes the year\u2019s longest day with moral reflections in verse, while practical pieces advise on June bulb care and defend \u201ca little learning\u201d as a public good.

{"76819": "\"Zonder geweer op jacht\" by William J. Long is a collection of nature essays written in the early 20th century. It celebrates observing wildlife without gun or camera, blending fieldcraft, natural history, and quiet philosophy to reveal the daily lives and behaviors of animals in the North American wilderness.  The opening of this collection lays out the author\u2019s credo of \u201chunting without a gun\u201d and then illustrates it through vivid encounters: deer using a lakeshore \u201cplayground\u201d of running circles and quick turns; a vigilant big buck wordlessly ending the game; a child calmly accepted by curious deer; close paddles among moose, including a massive bull with velvet antlers; and a twilight scene where ducks lift off at a silent communal signal. Next comes a kingfisher \u201cschool,\u201d with parents guarding a riverside burrow, enforcing fishing territories, and teaching fledglings to dive in a stocked practice pool before the young turn their lessons into playful contests. A portrait of the wildcat (bobcat) follows, stressing its unpredictability, patient fishing from logs, rumored whisker-lure tactics, and a striking anecdote of a stolen creel-net found high in a fir with the trapped thief inside. The section closes by turning to animal self\u2011medication, noting how people\u2014from Native traditions to early Greek medicine\u2014learned remedies by watching what sick animals sought in the wild.

{"76820": "\"The history of the Norman conquest of England, its causes and its results,\u2026.\" by Edward A. Freeman is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The work argues that the Norman Conquest was a decisive turning point\u2014not the beginning\u2014of English history, and examines its causes, course, and long-term effects on law, language, government, and society. Volume I focuses on the deep background in England and Normandy, especially the Anglo-Saxon formation of the English kingdom and the Danish and Norman contexts leading up to the election of Edward the Confessor.  The opening of the work presents revised prefaces explaining editorial updates, map improvements, and the author\u2019s method (including Old-English spellings), while answering critics and clarifying specific historical confusions. The introduction sets the thesis: the Conquest brought a powerful foreign infusion but preserved and reshaped existing English institutions; it was more than a dynastic change yet less than a people\u2019s displacement, and its later legal and linguistic effects grew over time. The plan of the narrative runs from early English and Norman histories through the reigns of Edward, Harold, and William, and on to the settling of results by the time of Edward I. At the start of the main text, the author sketches the heathen English conquest of Britain, distinguishing it from other Teutonic settlements: the English largely displaced the Romano-British order, retained their language, and were later Christianized from Rome, not by native Britons. He attributes this difference to Britain\u2019s weaker Romanization and the newcomers\u2019 distance from Roman civilization, and he rejects the tidy \u201cHeptarchy\u201d model while highlighting the leading early kingdoms (notably Kent, Wessex, East Anglia, and Northumbria) and the early growth of Wessex.

{"76821": "\"The sureness of MacKenzie by Frederick R. Bechdolt\" is a nautical short story written in the early 20th century. It centers on a veteran San Francisco bar pilot whose steadfast confidence is tested as he guides a great ocean liner through fog, surf, and shifting currents at the Golden Gate.  A telephone summons pulls MacKenzie from home on the eve of his grandchildren\u2019s birthday, and he heads out to the pilot boat in heavy weather, trading wagers and barbed talk with fellow pilots who chafe at his unshakable certainty. He aims to board the Empress, leaps for her Jacob\u2019s ladder in a rolling sea, and takes the bridge, threading her around the breaking bar and down North Channel. When a sudden fog drop and hill wind warp the siren signals and a strong ebb shoves the ship toward disaster at Fort Point, the captain panics; MacKenzie holds his course by feel, sound, and experience, seemingly steering into danger to clear Lime Point. The fog thins, the harbor opens, and the liner steams in safely. Home in time for the party, he dotes on the children while his family, amused and admiring, sums him up in a phrase: he is so sure.

It dramatizes the awakening of working-class consciousness in a small industrial community, focusing on labor rights, workplace injustice, and the pushback against corporate power.  The play unfolds in the blacksmith Perttu\u2019s home, where news rolls in: wages have been cut, the factory wants to buy the family\u2019s land, and the foreman Huikari has harassed Lyyli, Antti\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.

Huikari arrives proposing a \u201csettlement\u201d that would reinstate the men if agitation stops and the land sale proceeds, but Antti rejects the terms and demands Huikari\u2019s removal. Heljo, a young machinist, brings word that the workers have gathered, approved firm resolutions, and stand united.

The poems revolve around the tension between darkness and light, the cycles of nature and the seasons, inward longing and faith, and the shaping forces of homeland, myth, and memory.  The book moves from existential wandering to renewal. After an opening on the traveler\u2019s uncertain path, the first section sinks into night, storm, and mortality while guarding a stubborn spark of hope. The sonnets turn to longing, battle and fear (Ares), the forest\u2019s hidden springs, parents and inheritance, and a tragic echo of Aino. Muinaisuus looks back to antiquity and legend (Aphrodite), sketches a homeless prince and the quiet step of Death, then circles home to birthplace, childhood, and a prophetic voice that exalts steadfastness. In the final section, spring breaks the ice: waters loosen, light ascends, the human spirit kindles, sea sunrise and moonlit forest enlarge the gaze, and the title poem greets dawn\u2019s wings; symbols like the lily, hymns to happiness, and a closing \u201cResurrection\u201d seal the arc from wintered despair to liberated, luminous resolve.

He selects a crew, launches the Lady Alice with a canoe consort, and coasts south, taking soundings, tracing rivers, and hunting, while navigating threats from Ruga-Ruga bandits and the notorious robbers of Ndereh. Along the shore he records a gruesomely sacked village at Kiwesa, repeated signs that the lake level is rising (submerged trees, flooded fences, encroached fields), and striking geological features suggesting older, higher water or even formerly separate basins.

{"76828": "\"Through Keeweenaw by Keith Henney\" is a nautical short story written in the early 20th century. Set on the Great Lakes, it blends maritime realism with a subtle supernatural edge, focusing on a fogbound approach to the Portage Lake Canal and a captain haunted by past losses. The likely topic is a tense passage through fog where grief, superstition, and wireless technology intersect.  A radio operator narrates as a new skipper, Captain Trinder, takes command of the steamer Chippewa after years of avoiding the canal where his wife drowned and long after losing his grandson in another wreck. Fascinated by the idea that the dead might speak through radio, Trinder presses on into thick fog near the canal entrance, where the foghorn\u2019s direction proves unreliable and the ship edges dangerously close to the breakwater.

The book opens with clear definitions of studio and camera terms, then walks readers through idea generation, plot formation, pacing and reel length, scenario formatting, titling, synopses, character lists, scene design, continuity, and practical staging. It explains subtitles, inserts, letters, entrances and exits, sets, crisis-to-climax architecture, emotion and sympathy, revisions, manuscript preparation, sales practices, censorship, and the production pipeline, and ends with pointed \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d and a reassuring conclusion. A complete sample scenario, \u201cTimid Teddy,\u201d illustrates everything in practice: a timid young heir is plied with drink by his friend, proposes to the wrong women at a dance, and, after comic complications and a feigned report of financial ruin prompts both fianc\u00e9es to withdraw, finally proposes to the woman he truly loves, securing a happy ending.

{"76830": "\"Arts and crafts of old Japan\" by Stewart Dick is an introductory art history survey written in the early 20th century. Aimed at general readers rather than connoisseurs, it explains the aesthetics, materials, and methods behind Japan\u2019s traditional arts, from painting and color prints to sculpture, metalwork, ceramics, lacquer, gardens, and flower arrangement. It sets these arts within their social and historical context, contrasting Japanese conventions with Western expectations and highlighting the key schools, masters, and techniques that shaped \u201cold Japan.\u201d  The opening of Arts and crafts of old Japan sets out the author\u2019s purpose, cautions against unreliable criticism, and names a few dependable authorities, then offers a broad introduction arguing that Japan\u2019s refined aesthetic culture, calligraphic training, and lightweight architecture produced arts marked by suggestion, restraint, and superb design. It sketches Japan\u2019s historical backdrop\u2014from the arrival of Buddhism and temple-centered culture through samurai rule and Tokugawa peace to the disruptive contact with the West\u2014before surveying painting\u2019s forms, brush-based conventions, and major lineages (Buddhist imagery, Tosa/Yamato, the Chinese-influenced masters such as Sesshiu, the Kano school, Korin\u2019s decorative originality, and the Ukioy\u00e9 turn toward everyday life). The book then outlines the rise of color printing as a democratic art, its block-cutting and printing process, and its leading figures (Harunobu, Kiyonaga, Utamaro, Toyokuni, Hokusai, Hiroshige), noting later decline with aniline dyes; it proceeds to Buddhist sculpture in wood and bronze (including the colossal Buddhas of Nara and Kamakura), the shift to realistic portraits and netsuk\u00e9 miniatures, and finally to metalwork\u2014temple bells, lanterns, mirrors, the Miochin armourers, and the sword tradition\u2014pausing to describe casting methods and the ceremonial ethos of sword-forging.

{"76831": "\"Cap al tard :  Poesies by Joan Alcover\" is a collection of lyric and elegiac poems written in the early 20th century. The book explores Mallorcan landscapes and folk life, personal grief and faith, and a renewed sense of Catalan cultural identity.  The poems first celebrate the Serra de Tramuntana and the sea, giving voice to hermits, pines, sirens, and a captive vulture to reflect on freedom, destiny, and the island\u2019s soul. Pastoral scenes of villages and coves shift into moral and spiritual meditations, as a traveler finds refuge in an hermitage and the quiet is broken by an execution. The Elegies dwell on bells, childhood gardens, longing, and desolation, culminating in a dialogue with the Muse that turns private mourning\u2014especially for lost children\u2014into art and prayer. The book embraces the native tongue and history, honoring medieval valor in a poem of the cross, greeting Catalonia across the sea, and kindling a collective awakening in the vision of \u201cthe spark.\u201d Addresses to fellow artists and island scenes add portraits of contemporary culture and place. The final section gathers youthful pieces of love and devotion and concludes with a visionary homage to Ramon Llull, binding nature, memory, sorrow, and hope into a single, resonant voice.

{"76832": "\"S\u00e4mtliche Werke 21 : Der Spieler. Der ewige Gatte : Zwei Romane\" by Dostoyevsky is a collection of two novels written in the late 19th century. The volume couples a tale of gambling fever and romantic obsession at a European spa with a stark psychological study of jealousy and humiliation. In the first, a young Russian tutor is drawn to the roulette table and to the proud Polina amid a circle of schemers and pretenders; in the second, a haunted widower confronts a former rival. Across both, money, pride, and desire strip away social veneers among \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russians abroad.  The opening of Der Spieler follows Alexei, tutor to a Russian General\u2019s family, as he rejoins them in Roulettenburg, where they posture as wealthy while quietly awaiting an inheritance from the ailing \u201cBabushka.\u201d The General dazzles and borrows, a slick French \u201cmarquis\u201d and the calculating Mademoiselle Blanche circle, and the shy Englishman Mr. Astley silently adores Polina. Alexei\u2019s charged, unequal bond with Polina dominates: she commands him to gamble for her, and he first wins a tidy sum, then rashly loses everything, even as he grows convinced he will surely win when playing for himself. Between tense dinners and nationalist spats, Alexei studies the casino\u2019s rituals, the genteel pose versus plebeian hunger, and the household\u2019s dependence on news of the old woman\u2019s death. Polina hints at urgent debts and presses him for more money, while Alexei\u2019s pride, passion, and fatalism harden into a vow to test his luck alone. The section ends with their strained exchange hanging in the air and the roulette wheel looming as his chosen fate. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76833": "\"Der Liebe Lust und Leid der Frau zur Frau\" by Emilie Knopf is an erotic novel written in the late 19th century. The work examines women\u2019s same-sex desire within fashionable society, following the refined narrator Felicita and her captivating beloved Edita as admiration blossoms into passion, jealousy, and self-justification. Framed as a caution against excess while reveling in allure, it blends confession, romance, and social scandal.  The opening of the novel juxtaposes a press report about the book\u2019s obscenity case with a preface that invokes Sappho and casts the narrative as a warning about misdirected \u201cwomen\u2019s love.\u201d The story then introduces Felicita, a wealthy aesthete who meets Edita at a masquerade ball; their intense friendship swiftly becomes a love affair, celebrated in art and private moments. At a seaside resort Felicita is tempted by Comtesse Eug\u00e9nie, provoking Edita\u2019s hurt and a reconciliation that culminates at Edita\u2019s Rhine castle, where their bond deepens. Travel to Italy leads them into an aristocratic \u201cladies\u2019 night\u201d of voyeurism and indulgence, where Edita playfully stokes Felicita\u2019s jealousy before restoring harmony. On the return through Tyrol they befriend a singer and an industrialist\u2019s wife, overhearing a transactional liaison that the narrator views with distaste. Back home the pair devote themselves to painting and music, receive pupils, and later welcome the Venetian Marchesa and her companion\u2014where the excerpt ends.

{"76834": "\"The Arctic legions by A. De Herries Smith\" is a pulp adventure short story written in the early 20th century. The story centers on a Mountie and the dangerous prisoner he\u2019s captured, stranded amid a vast caribou migration on the Barren Lands, where their standoff becomes a brutal test of will, cunning, and survival against nature\u2019s relentless tide.  Corporal Conroy, injured and disarmed, faces Yeyik, the Yellowknife killer, on a boulder as millions of caribou thunder past. Yeyik taunts him with a stolen Colt while both men fray under the maddening click of hooves. Conroy needles the vain hunter into firing into the herd; Yeyik leaps onto a deer, and Conroy dives after him, the pair swallowed by the stampede. Fighting through the chaos, Conroy wrests control, hauls Yeyik back to safety, and waits as wolves arrive, signaling the migration\u2019s end. With the danger passed, he reclaims the gun, disarms the prisoner, and marches him toward the post across the suddenly silent Barrens. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76835": "\"Die Totent\u00e4nze by Wolfgang Stammler\" is a concise art-historical study written in the early 20th century. It examines the medieval and later \u201cDance of Death\u201d tradition, outlining its religious origins, visual forms, and didactic purpose while tracing how the motif evolved from church-wall cycles to prints and books and then into modern art.  The book opens with the medieval mindset of pious vigilance before death and the folk belief that the dead dance and draw the living into their ranks, a warning the clergy turned into moral instruction. It distinguishes two main image types: an earlier, solemn, processional dance anchored by preaching and biblical scenes, and a later, livelier, often grotesque dance in which animated corpses seize their partners; key cycles in France, Germany, and beyond illustrate both strands. The author then follows the theme into manuscripts and blockbooks with captioned dialogues, where pairing a dead figure with a living one paved the way for the personified Death, culminating in the Renaissance with Holbein\u2019s decisive reinterpretation of Death interrupting everyday life. Finally, the survey sketches the motif\u2019s persistence through Baroque and Rococo variants to 19th- and early 20th-century renewals (including responses to war), and closes with a brief anthology of examples and images, ending on a lyrical reflection about death\u2019s abiding presence.

{"76836": "\"The common sense of sex by James Oppenheim\" is a short work of popular psychology and sex education written in the early 20th century. It presents a clear, non-puritan view of sexuality, blending psychoanalytic ideas with practical guidance, and argues that sexual life is natural, varied, and best approached with informed common sense.  The book surveys Freud\u2019s account of infantile sexuality, fixation, perversion, and sublimation; contrasts it with Jung\u2019s critiques, his introvert\u2013extravert types, and the four functions (thinking, feeling, intuition, sensation) to show why sexuality differs so widely among individuals. It evaluates claims about a \u201cthird sex,\u201d reframing them as mixtures of masculine and feminine principles present in everyone, and emphasizes Havelock Ellis\u2019s \u201cart of love,\u201d where foreplay and mutual responsiveness elevate the act. The author warns against universal moral codes, explaining how fear, repression, mismating, and social pressures (fear of pregnancy, anxiety about impotence, rigid monogamy) distort desire, while misplaced creative energy can fuel perversions or crusading zeal. He urges sex education, compassionate guidance for youth (including handling auto-erotism), nuanced views on homosexuality and prostitution, and flexible, humane arrangements in adult relationships. It closes with an ideal of love that unites tenderness, passion, and respect, encouraging couples to find their own ethical way. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76837": "\"Three essays\" by Thomas Mann is a collection of essays written in the early 20th century. The volume examines towering figures and ideas\u2014chiefly Goethe and Tolstoy, but also Frederick the Great and an occult episode\u2014to probe how art, culture, power, and belief shape human life. Expect comparative criticism, historical reflection, and personal insight rather than narrative fiction.  The opening of the book presents the essay \u201cGoethe and Tolstoy,\u201d beginning with an anecdote about a Weimar schoolmaster who glimpsed Goethe in youth and, decades later, unknowingly hosted Tolstoy in his classroom\u2014an encounter used to justify juxtaposing the two. From there, the author develops a wide-ranging comparison that treats the \u201cand\u201d between their names as a principled contrast, weighing questions of rank and \u201cgodlike\u201d charisma, their shared Rousseauian inheritance (nature, education, confession), and the polarity of nature versus spirit, classic versus romantic, health versus disease, and freedom versus necessity. Goethe and Tolstoy are paired as children of nature and creation, set against Schiller and Dostoyevsky as champions of spirit and critique; this frames Tolstoy\u2019s lifelong struggle to renounce nature for moral rigor, his crises and illnesses, and parallel moments in Goethe\u2019s career. The section surveys their attitudes toward art, music, and society, evokes the pilgrim magnetism of Weimar and Yasnaya Polyana, notes their aristocratic bearing, and closes mid-argument as it contrasts Tolstoy\u2019s sensuous realism with Dostoyevsky\u2019s visionary idealism and revisits Goethe\u2019s poised acceptance of necessity.

{"76838": "\"Error''s chains :  How forged and broken : A comparative history of the\u2026\" by Frank S. Dobbins is a comparative religious history written in the late 19th century. Aimed at general readers and richly illustrated, it surveys how humanity moved from an original monotheism into nature-worship, polytheism, and idolatry across civilizations, contrasting these with Christianity. Drawing on sacred texts, folklore, archaeology, and travel accounts, it traces global beliefs, myths, and rituals to show how \u201cerror\u201d was forged and how it might be remedied.  The opening of the work sets out its popular purpose, sources, and scope, then argues that humanity began with one God and later declined into many gods and idols. The preface promises a readable, illustrated tour of world religions, credits scholarly helpers, and states a Christian aim: to heighten appreciation for biblical faith and concern for the \u201cheathen\u201d world. Chapter I presents two witnesses for an original unity\u2014an \u201cold record\u201d (Genesis) and the kinship of languages\u2014then uses comparative folklore (the \u201cMaster Thief\u201d cycle in Norse, Egyptian, Hindu, Spanish, and Scottish variants) to argue for a common cultural origin before the dispersion from Babel; it also notes widespread \u201cgolden age\u201d memories and traces of a supreme deity. Chapter II explains the transition from monotheism to nature-worship and personification of the elements, quotes early hymns (Varuna, Indra, Agni, Surya) and prayers, and sketches how idols likely arose (from aids to devotion and sacred stones to animal and human forms like teraphim, Dagon, and serpent images). Chapter III begins compiling creation and flood traditions\u2014from Chaldean Xisuthrus and Hindu Manu to Chinese Fuh-he, Mexican Coxcox/Tezpi, Fijian and North American tales, and Greek Deucalion\u2014using their shared contours to reinforce the biblical narrative, and it moves toward the Babel story as the next link.

{"76839": "A knife in time by Ray Humphreys is a Western short story written in the early 20th century. It centers on frontier mule-skinning, workplace rivalry, and a public wagon-race where a scorned driver\u2019s knife and nerve become crucial.  Tom Morgan, a slight but gifted mule skinner, is mocked by fellow teamsters for wearing a sheath knife, despite the wagon boss McCarthy valuing his skill. When the Q B outfit brings five polished hitches to a rodeo race overseen by the owner, Ashton, the event turns dangerous: Ashton\u2019s borrowed sorrel mule bolts, dragging him by a caught stirrup straight into the path of the racing wagons. Morgan leaps from his seat, scrambles along his moving hitch, mounts a leader, and slices that mule free to chase the runaway. His driverless team collides with another, killing a mule and injuring a driver, but Morgan presses on, transfers to the sorrel at speed, and cuts Ashton loose just in time. In the aftermath, Morgan explains he carries the knife after once losing mules he might have saved; Ashton, grateful and alive, ends the crew\u2019s prejudice and promotes Morgan to assistant wagon boss.

{"76840": "\"Elettyj\u00e4 pikkuseikkailuja\" by Knut Hamsun is a collection of short stories written in the early 20th century. The pieces are autobiographical vignettes of \u201clived little adventures,\u201d shifting from American prairies and Parisian boulevards to a stark Norwegian parish. A frank, restless first-person narrator observes fear, crowds, work, and the uncanny with sharp sensory detail and dry humor. Readers get atmospheric snapshots rather than a single plot, anchored by the narrator\u2019s roaming life.  The opening of the collection first offers a compact biographical sketch of the author\u2019s life and major works, then moves into several first-person episodes. In \u201cPelkoa,\u201d the narrator recalls a night in Madelia on the American prairie when intruders break into a house, triggering overwhelming terror as he bluffs them off with a single bullet. \u201cMuuan katuvallankumous\u201d recreates Paris street unrest in the 1890s, from barricades and smashed lamps to scuffles with police and soldiers, mixing menace with absurdity (an umbrella \u201cconfiscated\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s a revolution\u201d). \u201cAave\u201d returns to a northern childhood: after pocketing a tooth from a graveyard, the boy is haunted for years by a red-bearded apparition with a missing tooth. \u201cVehn\u00e4aavikolla\u201d sketches grueling harvest work on the Red River wheat plains, the eccentric Irishman Evans, a snake slipping into a Swede\u2019s boot, and the raucous post\u2011payday spree where Evans borrows the narrator\u2019s wallet to gamble, then regains control and wins back money.

The book blends fairy-tale fantasy, Finnish folklore, and everyday rural life, offering lullabies, play-songs, letters in verse, seasonal pieces, and moral fables for young readers.  Across short, melodic poems, a small girl resists a witch\u2019s lure and runs home, a boy and his loyal dog brave make-believe dangers, and lively portraits of children\u2014Irja, Liisa, Niilo, and Anni\u2014show games, chores, letters to parents, and earnest prayers. House and sauna spirits (tonttu) fuss over family order and kind behavior; carols and star-processions bring Christmas awe; a street musician\u2019s song hints at loneliness and hope; and a closing fable pits a sly raven against a wary dove to warn against flattery and deceit. Nature, home, and imagination weave through the pieces, gently guiding children toward courage, kindness, and the comfort of family. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76842": "\"Fools and mules :  [A Shorty McKay story] by Ray Humphreys\" is a Western short story written in the early 20th century. Set in the snowbound Sangre de Cristo mountains near Monte Vista, it centers on a perilous winter payroll run and a run-in with a notorious road agent. The likely topic is a frontier adventure that blends danger, irony, and rough humor to test a deputy\u2019s judgment and highlight the surprising worth of a mule.  Shorty McKay is tasked with carrying a mine\u2019s payroll through deep snow; he rejects a mule for his trusted horse, Lobo Loco. On a narrow, icy trail he\u2019s held up by Buck Bancroft, who rides a huge white mule, and is forced to ride that mule, bound and captive. A sudden avalanche sweeps Shorty and the mule into a snow pocket, while Lobo Loco turns back, bolts to town, and\u2014by scraping the dozing outlaw off in a stable\u2014delivers Bancroft and the recovered cash to the sheriff. Stranded and helpless, Shorty survives the night as the mule\u2019s relentless braying guides Sheriff Cook\u2019s rescue party to their hidden perch. Humbled, Shorty admits his mistake about \u201cfools and mules,\u201d insists the mule be saved first, and concedes that in a pinch the mule\u2019s noise and stamina were the difference between life and death.

{"76843": "The Army Behind the Army by E. Alexander Powell is a historical account written in the early 20th century. It explores the often unseen services and technologies that sustained the American Expeditionary Forces in World War I\u2014especially communications, engineering, transportation, and other logistical arms. The focus is on how specialists and technicians, rather than front-line troops alone, made large-scale modern warfare possible.  The opening of the volume recasts the Signal Corps as the army\u2019s \u201cnerve-system,\u201d replacing the flag-waving myth with telephones, radios, pigeons, runners, panels, lamps, and an extensive wire network. Powell outlines the corps\u2019 rapid expansion, its recruitment of U.S. telephone talent (including female operators), the creation of color-coded outpost wire, and secrecy tools like buzzerphones and twisted-pair lines. He highlights listening-posts that tapped enemy currents, radio-intercept and direction-finding teams that mapped German nets and even staged a deceptive \u201cfalse corps net,\u201d and the reliability and heroism of carrier pigeons when every other link failed. A photographic branch\u2014air and ground\u2014trained specialists to map, report, teach, and buoy morale with films that countered enemy propaganda. The section closes with striking innovations: radiotelephony with aircraft, multiplexing many calls over a single wire, trees used as natural radio antennae, and a practical, unbreakable cipher-transmission device. The narrative then turns to the Engineers\u2014motto \u201cEssayons\u201d\u2014showing their vast remit from fighting as needed to building railways, ports, roads, and forests-to-lumber operations, operating inland waterways, shipping complete locomotives, and even fielding armored railcars, before introducing the life-or-death problem of supplying water to armies on the move.

{"76844": "\"Medieval rhetoric and poetic to 1400: Interpreted from representative works\" by Charles Sears Baldwin is a scholarly study written in the early 20th century. It traces how medieval theories of composition\u2014rhetoric and poetic\u2014both reflected and shaped education and literature, reading them through key texts and practices. The volume follows the transmission from antiquity, the dominance of style in the schools, and the complementary roles of sermons, letters, hymnody, and verse narrative, culminating in the vernacular achievements of Dante and Chaucer.  The opening of this study sets out its plan and stakes: to read medieval rhetoric and poetic historically and in tandem, showing how they descend from late Roman schooling, absorb St. Augustine\u2019s reforming impulse for preaching, and become largely a lore of style in the hands of the medieval grammarian. It then begins with a concise genealogy of sophistic rhetoric, contrasting Plato\u2019s suspicion with Aristotle\u2019s broader, moral theory of rhetoric, and explaining how the loss of deliberative public speech pushed ancient practice toward display and panegyric. Baldwin sketches the \u201csecond sophistic\u201d via Philostratus\u2014its virtuosity, theme-based declamation, improvisation, theatrical delivery, decorative dilation (notably ecphrasis), and reliance on fixed patterns. He illustrates how school exercises (the progymnasmata of Hermogenes\u2014fable, chria, encomium, comparison, characterization, ecphrasis, thesis, and more) crystallized habits that prized balance, archaism, clausular cadence, and vehemence over sustained argument. The section closes by implying that such empty technic required a new motive\u2014ultimately supplied by Christian preaching\u2014to restore rhetoric\u2019s larger purpose.

{"76845": "\"The golden pool :  A story of a forgotten mine\" by R. Austin Freeman is a novel written in the early 20th century. It follows Richard Englefield, a weary English bank clerk who seizes a chance to ship out as purser on the brig Lady Jane and is drawn into West African trading, local legends, and hints of hidden gold. Guided and sometimes misled by sailors, merchants, and colonials\u2014including Captain Bithery and the dignified trader Pereira\u2014he stumbles on stories of a sacred treasure and a \u201cforgotten\u201d mine that promise peril and discovery.  The opening of the story traces how a misplaced matchbox leads Englefield into a tavern brawl, a hasty rescue of a surly shipmaster, and an impulsive offer to sail as purser to the West African coast. After a fair voyage, he helps establish trade at Quittah, learning the rhythms of buying and selling palm oil, rubber, and copra, while hearing unsettling tales: a Hausa merchant\u2019s talk of a king\u2019s treasure house and \u201cmany blind men,\u201d and Pereira\u2019s account of fetish-guarded gold at the Aboasi pool.

{"76846": "\"The three sphinxes, and other poems by George Sylvester Viereck\" is a collection of lyric and dramatic poems written in the early 20th century. The book probes the tensions between erotic desire and spiritual idealism, drawing on myth, religion, and modern psychology to meditate on love, art, faith, and mortality.  An opening essay frames the poems as \u201ccomplexes\u201d revolving around Eros, Jesus, Lilith, and Eve. The title poem stages a dialogue in the desert where facets of Love confront the sacred and the bestial; elsewhere, terse pieces weigh fate and biology, while longer monologues and ballads reimagine biblical and cultural figures to test moral codes. A fierce credo reduces human certainties to appetite and death; a visit from Christ to a Puritan town rebukes joyless piety; Faust tires of heaven and hell while yearning to fuse Helen and Marguerite; Eve speaks the long suffering of women; and tributes, elegies, and city-visions praise the stubborn life of art. Across love lyrics, satires, and visionary psalms, the collection moves between ecstasy and disenchantment, ending in stark addresses to God and man\u2019s frail, defiant will.

{"76847": "\"Ristimiekka by Jussi Snellman\" is a collection of lyric poems written in the early 20th century. The book meditates on spiritual struggle and redemption, the ache of love and solitude, and the pull of nature and conscience against the noise of modern life.  The opening sequence frames a moral transformation as a killing sword becomes a blessing cross, then moves through prayers from darkness, visions of stars and hell, and images of withering trees and waterlilies torn between roots and sun. A central cluster of love poems swings between rapture and remorse: ecstatic meetings by shore and forest path, sleepless waiting, erotic abandon that still longs for the beloved\u2019s soul, and parting as two currents drift to opposite banks. Spring poems widen the view to freedom and flight, a caged swan\u2019s yearning, hymns to creation, and portraits of an idealist who rejects violence, a serene grandmother, and an artist whose marble dreams outshine a corrupt world. Summer brings playful and satiric pieces about haste, voyeurism, drink, and human vanity, before the voice turns inward again to say that each of us is crucified in some way. The final section follows a seeker who pleads for truth, receives a quiet commission to bear light, contemplates Gandhi\u2019s nonviolent courage, and ends in a humble, encompassing prayer.

{"76851": "\"First course in biology\" by L. H. Bailey and Walter Moore Coleman is a secondary-school biology textbook written in the early 20th century. It presents plant, animal, and human biology as a unified, practical course that favors observation, experiment, and everyday relevance over rote facts. Readers can expect clear explanations, abundant classroom and field exercises, and an ecological perspective that ties structure and function to environment.  The opening of the textbook sets a reform-minded tone, advocating a single unit course in biology for secondary students and outlining flexible ways to sequence plant, animal, and human topics. A general introduction then builds essential chemistry and physics skills through simple experiments\u2014testing acids and bases, starch, sugar, proteids, and fats; making oxygen; demonstrating oxidation; contrasting organic and inorganic matter; and analyzing a candle flame to reveal oxygen consumption, carbon (soot), and carbon dioxide. Plant Biology begins by stressing variation, environmental struggle, and selection (including human selection in breeding), then surveys plant societies (ecology), plant parts and life histories (annuals, biennials, perennials). It proceeds to seeds and germination with hands-on studies of beans, castor beans, corn, and gymnosperms, and concludes with root forms and functions\u2014tap and fibrous systems, aerial and adventitious roots, root hairs and osmosis, nitrogen-fixing nodules, and the importance of moisture, temperature, and air\u2014ending mid-discussion of root structure.

{"76852": "The chocolate-plant (Theobroma cacao) and its products by Anonymous is a scientific and industrial pamphlet from the late 19th century. It surveys cacao\u2019s origins, botany, chemistry, cultivation, processing into chocolate and cocoa, their nutritional qualities, and practical culinary uses.  The book opens with the pre-Columbian and early colonial history of cacao, describing indigenous roasting, grinding, and foaming methods and the swift spread of chocolate in Europe. It then details the plant\u2019s morphology and growth, the bearing of pods on older wood, shade and irrigation needs, harvesting, fermentation (\u201csweating\u201d), drying, and major producing regions. A technical chapter characterizes commercial beans microscopically and chemically, noting starch, cellulose, proteins, theobromine, ash, and especially cocoa-butter. Manufacturing chapters explain cleaning, roasting, winnowing to nibs, fine grinding into plain or sweetened chocolate, pressing to reduce fat for breakfast cocoa, and caution against chemically alkalized cocoas that diminish natural flavor. A physiological section argues cacao\u2019s value as real food\u2014combining carbohydrates, proteins, minerals, and theobromine\u2014and explains why partial fat removal can aid digestion while purity and fineness are essential. The closing portion offers cooking guidance and recipes (by Mrs. Ellen H. Richards and Miss Parloa) for properly boiling chocolate and cocoa and for using them in drinks, cakes, icings, ice-cream, puddings, and Bavarian cream.

{"76853": "\"Blank en Bruin\" by Hilbrandt Boschma is a juvenile novel written in the late 19th century. It follows Leo van Dintelburg, a Dutch-Indies boy, and his Javanese guardian Bamboe as they settle in a Dutch town, where schoolyard rivalry, class pride, and racial prejudice test character and faith. Opposite Leo stands Rudolf van Dintelburg, a privileged classmate, and the story frames youth as a choice between two paths, with a clear Christian, didactic bent.  The opening of the novel sets out a prefatory promise: a contemporary Dutch tale for boys that avoids chauvinism, stays close to recent history, and urges youth to devote their lives to God by showing the contrast between serving Him and not. The story then introduces Bamboe and Leo arriving with parrots and a monkey, drawing rude curiosity from local boys led by Rudolf; Leo\u2019s quick wit and a policeman end the first confrontation. At school, Mr. Selhof welcomes Leo, explains his mixed Dutch\u2013Javanese background, and the class warm to him, with cultural misunderstandings (like \u201ckool/kolen\u201d) used for gentle humor. Tensions rise when Rudolf challenges Leo over the shared surname, but Dirk Drijver sides with Leo. Winter brings a planned, rule-bound snowball battle; Leo\u2019s side fortifies a \u201cfort,\u201d a fierce fight ends with Rudolf accidentally felled by his own hard snowball, after which Leo and Bamboe tend him and Leo offers friendship\u2014rejected out of class and color prejudice. The scene shifts to skating, where Rudolf spitefully sends a ball toward thin ice; Leo falls through, Bamboe bravely tries to save him and also goes in, and the episode breaks off with Dirk attempting a risky rescue.

{"76854": "Letters from a living dead man by David Patterson Hatch is a spiritualist epistolary work written in the early 20th century. It presents purported messages from a recently deceased thinker known as \u201cX,\u201d conveyed through a medium, describing the conditions, laws, and experiences of consciousness after death. Expect vivid accounts of astral travel, teachers and helpers, reincarnation, heavens and hells, and the mechanics of cross\u2011world communication, with recurring figures like a guiding Teacher and a boy named Lionel.  The opening of this work begins with an introduction from the recorder explaining how the letters started through automatic writing in Paris, the surprising news of \u201cX\u2019s\u201d death, her reluctance and later decision to publish, and her insistence that the communications be judged by their substance. The early letters then unfold: \u201cX\u201d asserts his presence, explains the ease and brightness of the transition, asks for discretion, and teaches safeguards against intrusive astral influences and the mental poise needed for writing. He describes movement and perception in the subtle world; the role of will; the \u201cpattern world\u201d of prototypes; a League that helps the newly dead; and meetings with souls, including Lionel, along with glimpses of a \u201cheaven country\u201d and a Christ vision. He reports visiting archives (a Paracelsus treatise), shaping garments by thought, and warns the newly departed not to revisit their corpses; he relates a marital tangle between a man and his two wives, notes individualized hells, and tells of a devoted couple reunited in a home he built for her. The section closes with reflections on finding God (\u201cGod is\u201d), the rhythm of rebirth and eternity, a defense of this controlled collaboration (distinguishing it from indiscriminate mediumship), and a final vignette setting off to witness a great imperial funeral.

Framed by affectionate humor and melancholy, the narrator sketches the veteran\u2019s rituals, pride, and soldierly code before yielding to his battlefield voice. Readers should expect a lively historical yarn about courage, blunders, and camaraderie in the Revolutionary era.  The opening of the story presents the narrator\u2019s youthful memories of an elderly Mons\u00f9 Tom\u00e8 in Loano: a solitary former officer with a ceremonious Sunday drinking rite and a store of war stories unlocked by the right prompt.

{"76858": "\"The spirit-rapper; an autobiography\" by Orestes Augustus Brownson is a fictional autobiography written in the mid-19th century. It examines the rise of mesmerism and modern Spiritualism through the first-person account of a scientifically minded New Yorker who is drawn from curiosity into clairvoyance, spirit-rapping, and table-turning. Alongside ministers, reformers, and social radicals, he probes the claims and perils of these phenomena, weighing science, faith, and moral consequences.  The opening of the narrative presents a prefatory statement that the work blends fact with fictional \u201cmachinery\u201d to scrutinize spirit-manifestations and their links to reformist enthusiasms. The narrator then recounts his sober scientific education and early scepticism, his introduction to a French mesmerist\u2019s convincing demonstrations, and a circle of interlocutors debating whether the effects arise from imagination, a human \u201cdemonic\u201d force, or something darker. As mesmerism spreads, a lighthearted practitioner, Jack Wheatley, kills his fianc\u00e9e by overusing it and is haunted by her apparition, while the narrator himself develops an intense desire for hidden power. Moving among Philadelphia reformers, he witnesses and conducts experiments that surpass mere suggestion\u2014remote mesmerism, magnetized objects inducing trance, and clairvoyance that exceeds any \u201crapport.\u201d He learns automatic speech and writing under a foreign will, then shifts to using objects as instruments, producing table movement and coded raps, and is told he can gain greater knowledge only if he purifies his motives\u2014just as the excerpt breaks off.

{"76859": "\"The false assumptions of \"democracy\" by Anthony M. Ludovici is a political treatise written in the early 20th century. It argues that modern democratic ideals rest on muddled language and seductive slogans, and urges a rigorous redefinition of key political terms. The work challenges egalitarianism and socialism, defends private property as a life-affirming principle, and seeks to disentangle justice, freedom, and equality from popular misconceptions.  The opening of the treatise frames its project with a supportive letter and a preface that, in the shadow of the Great War, calls for a sober \u201cstock-taking\u201d of ideals and a reclarification of language to avert social breakdown. The introduction claims that the loss of a common culture has emptied abstract words\u2014freedom, justice, equality\u2014of meaning, turning them into emotional \u201cmissiles,\u201d with journalism and propaganda accelerating the decay; Rousseau\u2019s misuse of \u201cNature,\u201d \u201cFreedom,\u201d and \u201cMan\u201d is cited as a model of how such confusion births revolution. The first chapter defends private property as the biological and moral expression of growth and self-extension, criticizes abolitionist schemes as symptoms of cultural exhaustion, concedes real abuses (misallocated power, degrading labor, unhealthy poverty, unearned advantages), and proposes changing social valuations so wealth does not automatically equal power. Subsequent early chapters argue that \u201cimmanent justice\u201d is a myth because nature is amoral and justice is purely social, and that equality (including \u201cequality of opportunity\u201d) is incoherent beyond mathematics\u2014leaving only equal protection of interests under law as a sensible aim.

{"76860": "\"Vidas cruzadas :  Cinedrama en dos partes, dividida la primera en diez cuadros\u2026.\" by Jacinto Benavente is a play written in the early 20th century. Set among fashionable resorts and Madrid salons, it explores the collision of old aristocracy and new money through a poised, impoverished noblewoman, Eugenia Castrojeriz, her reckless brother Manolo, and the wealthy upstart Enrique Garcimora. Pride, class, and desire entangle them as an allegorical \u201cLadr\u00f3n de sue\u00f1os\u201d reveals what their waking selves deny.  The opening of the play unfolds on a Biarritz dancing terrace, where two onlookers frame the action with sharp social commentary before introducing Eugenia, her loyal friend Guillermina, and Enrique\u2019s pursuit. A nocturnal dream interlude, guided by the \u201cLadr\u00f3n de sue\u00f1os,\u201d exposes the mutual attraction and clashing pride of Eugenia and Enrique through a queen-and-pirate metaphor. Meanwhile, Manolo\u2019s gambling spirals: Isidoro begs Enrique for help, and Enrique\u2019s valet Dami\u00e1n discovers Manolo has stolen an envelope of cash, leading to a heated confrontation that Manolo first denies and then, in private, bitterly repents while hinting at suicide. Warned by Isidoro, Eugenia rushes to plead with Enrique, and the scene closes with her waiting in his study under the dream-thief\u2019s light. At the start of the second part, a Madrid party hums with gossip about Eugenia\u2019s sudden distance from her protectors, signaling that the scandal\u2019s social aftershocks are spreading.

{"76861": "\"Eccentricities of genius : memories of famous men and women of the platform\u2026\" by Major J. B. Pond is a collection of reminiscences and character sketches written in the late 19th century. From the vantage point of a leading lecture manager, it surveys orators, preachers, actors, humorists, explorers, and authors who animated the lyceum and the stage, mixing backstage anecdotes with public portraits. The emphasis is on the quirks, habits, and magnetism that made them draw crowds, and on the culture of the lecture platform itself. The result is a lively insider\u2019s tour of the era\u2019s great public voices.  The opening of the volume presents title matter, a contents and illustration list, and a playful preface stitched from other writers\u2019 prefaces, then shifts to Pond\u2019s own origin story: a frontier, abolitionist upbringing; a printer\u2019s apprenticeship; time in \u201cBleeding Kansas\u201d; and later journalism in Utah that led to managing Ann Eliza Young\u2019s sensational lectures and a swift national stir. He recounts acquiring the Redpath Bureau, his credo for approaching famous people, and signals the book\u2019s scope across orators, clergy, women lecturers, humorists, explorers, actors, and authors. The first profiles elevate the \u201ctriumvirate\u201d of Gough, Beecher, and Wendell Phillips, then sketch Garrison, Sumner, Depew, Horace Porter, Ingersoll, Frederick Douglass, and Booker T. Washington with brisk judgments and vivid anecdotes. The section on Beecher becomes an intimate travel memoir, including Southern appearances where initial hostility turned to ovations\u2014most memorably in Richmond\u2014showcasing Beecher\u2019s courage, persuasive power, and gift for reconciliation.

This is for curious walkers, gardeners, and young naturalists who enjoy learning by looking.  The opening of the book sets the scene with a foreword that frames this volume as the capstone of a seasonal series, then slips into a lively tour of early winter. It describes the first great leaf-fall after autumn storms, children\u2019s play, and the patient wait for true frost, before guiding the reader to late mushrooms and earthstars, and to beachcombing after gales that wash up kittiwakes, auks, puffins, and gannets.

{"76869": "\"Buddhism by Annie H. Small\" is a comparative religious study written in the early 20th century. It presents the core ideas of Buddhism and sets them alongside Christian beliefs, focusing on the origins of suffering, the moral law, the way of self-renunciation, and the meaning of salvation.  The book begins with India and Gautama: his sheltered youth, shock at suffering, rejection of ritual and extreme asceticism, enlightenment under the Bo tree, and his teaching of the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. It outlines Buddhist ethics for ordinary life (avoiding the ten sins and living kindly, truthfully, and temperately) and the stricter path of the saint (breaking the fetters of self through discipline, taking refuge in Buddha, Law, and Church, and seeking Nirvana). The focus then shifts to Israel and Jesus: the prophetic hope, Jesus\u2019 open, non-ritual life of service, His self-forgetful union with the Father, and the Cross understood as the seed that dies to bring a harvest\u2014fulfilling the universal law of cause and effect through love. The Christian way is self-surrender in daily life, a desire redirected from self to the Father, with no divide between lay and saint; each yielded life becomes new seed for the Kingdom. Poems contrast the two ideals, and a final comparison affirms real resemblances yet a decisive difference: the Buddha as the conqueror who wins knowledge, and the Christ as the revealed Truth and Way.

{"76871": "\"The magnificent possession by Isaac Asimov\" is a humorous science fiction short story written in the early 20th century. It centers on a chemist\u2019s breakthrough in isolating metallic ammonium and creating a brilliant gold-like oxide, setting off a satirical scramble involving industry, politics, and crime.  Walter Sills, a cash-strapped chemist aided by his friend Eugene Taylor, discovers a solvent that lets him separate and briefly stabilize ammonium, then produces a glittering \u201csubstitute gold\u201d oxide that promises riches. Newspaper fame draws a predatory industrialist, a blustering ex-congressman, and a notorious gangster into a chaotic night of break-ins and bluff. Though Sills secures his real notes in a bank, the crooks steal decoys. Seeking proof before a big sale, Sills and Taylor plate a spoon with ammonium\u2014only to unleash an indescribably noxious stench when it meets ordinary air, panicking the neighborhood and sending their prospective buyer fleeing. The pair finally wade into the Hudson for clean air, mourning their fiasco yet clinging to the hope that the discovery will still bring renown\u2014and perhaps a fix for the fatal smell.

{"76872": "\"Tragedies of sex\" by Frank Wedekind is a collection of plays written in the late 19th and early 20th century. Gathering Spring\u2019s Awakening, Earth-Spirit, Pandora\u2019s Box, and Damnation!, it confronts sexual desire, repression, and bourgeois hypocrisy with frank, unsettling drama. The pieces focus on volatile youth and predatory or compromised adults\u2014most notably the schoolchildren Melchior, Wendla, and Moritz, and the magnetic Lulu\u2014to expose how authority and morality deform private life.  The opening of the volume frames the author as an avant-garde provocateur and precursor to Expressionism, then launches into the first stretch of Spring\u2019s Awakening. We meet Wendla, chafing at being forced into adult decorum; schoolboys Melchior and Moritz, who debate sex and struggle under academic pressure; and girls who reveal domestic abuse, especially Martha. Moritz secretly checks the promotion lists and, provisionally passed, swings from relief to dread. In the woods, Melchior and Wendla spar over charity and morality before a disturbing moment in which she asks to be struck and he loses control. Subsequent scenes deepen the sexual awakening and confusion: Melchior\u2019s candid discussions with Moritz (and his tolerant mother), Wendla\u2019s mother\u2019s evasions about where babies come from, Hansy\u2019s furtive self-gratification, and a charged hayloft encounter between Melchior and Wendla. A letter shows Melchior\u2019s mother refusing to fund Moritz\u2019s escape, urging fortitude; Wendla drifts through the garden in dazed, secretive joy; and Moritz, by the river at dusk, edges toward despair.

{"76873": "\"Wrecked among cannibals in the Fijis :  A narrative of shipwreck & adventure in\u2026\" by William Endicott is a historical maritime narrative written in the early 20th century. It recounts a Salem third mate\u2019s beche-de-mer trading voyage across the South Seas, culminating in shipwreck among the Fiji Islands, encounters with warlike communities, and hard-won survival. The volume blends first-hand seafaring adventure with ethnographic observation, and is supplemented by editorial notes, illustrations, and brief vocabularies of local languages.  The opening of the narrative sets the scene with an editor\u2019s introduction to New England\u2019s youthful seafaring culture, the ship Glide\u2019s history, the beche-de-mer trade geared to the Chinese market, and the constant need for arms and vigilance in Fiji. Endicott then begins his log: departing Salem, touching at the Bay of Islands in New Zealand and the Friendly (Tonga) Islands for provisions and interpreters, and entering the reef-laced Fijis. After striking a rock, the Glide is assisted by the Salem brig Quill; the crew constructs a raft, heaves the ship down, and effects makeshift repairs. Shore stations are built to cure beche-de-mer, large numbers of islanders are hired, and trade goods (iron tools, muskets, whale\u2019s teeth) change hands, but early setbacks arrive fast\u2014fires, theft, and shifting to new bays as supplies thin and tensions rise.

{"76876": "\"Webster''s practical forestry :  A popular handbook on the rearing and growth of\u2026.\" by A. D. Webster is a practical forestry handbook written in the early 20th century. It focuses on profitable and ornamental tree growing in Britain, blending policy advocacy with step-by-step guidance for establishing nurseries, plantations, and timber production. The work emphasizes species choice, site preparation, and cultivation methods aimed at both commercial returns and landscape value.  The opening of the handbook frames forestry as a wartime and postwar necessity, arguing that foreign timber shortages demand large-scale, state-led afforestation of waste lands, with compact blocks to ensure continuous supply and to justify transport, and proposing this work as employment for returning and convalescent service members. It outlines costs, suitable regions, and the economic case for government ownership and planning. The text then turns practical, explaining how to collect, dry, store, and sow seeds (especially conifer cones), offering seed counts and species-by-species timing; how to propagate by seed, cuttings, layers, grafts, and buds; and how to plan and run a home nursery with seasonal tasks. Next it details forming plantations: setting boundaries, laying out roads and fences, draining and levelling, clearing vegetation, pitting vs. notch planting, timing by site conditions, and avoiding too-deep planting. Finally, it begins its list of the best economic trees, describing growth conditions, timber qualities, and uses for oak, ash, beech, sycamore, Spanish chestnut, elm, alder, birch, and the cricket-bat willow.

{"76877": "\"I simboli :  in rapporto alla storia e filosofia del diritto, alla psicologia\u2026.\" by Guglielmo Ferrero is a scientific publication written in the late 19th century. This essay investigates how symbols arise from human psychology and social needs, linking them to the development of law, religion, language, and institutions. It advances the idea that the law of least mental effort and mental inertia govern symbolic practices, with real consequences for justice, politics, and collective error.  The opening of the work presents a brief preface defining the book as a preliminary exploration and crediting Paolo Marzolo\u2019s Saggio sui segni as its chief inspiration, while arguing that understanding symbolism can mitigate social injustices born of intellectual weaknesses. The Introduction develops two governing principles: humans avoid mental labor (the law of least effort) and the mind is inert unless stirred by sensory input; attention is rare and tiring, most thinking is unconscious association, institutions evolve by small, practical steps, and sensations revive ideas and emotions (illustrated with hypnosis, dynamogenesis, and everyday examples). Part I begins by explaining \u201csymbols of proof\u201d: before writing and archives, societies used visible acts as evidence\u2014delivery of a clod for land transfer, touching a door or hinge to convey a house, leading a bride from her home, couvade as a public claim of paternity, clothing or passing a limb over an adoptee, offering keys or weapons to signal submission, handing weapons to free a slave, opening doors or sending a freed person to a crossroads, rekindling home fire to mark new domicile, and throwing stones to denounce new works. The next chapter turns to \u201cdescriptive\u201d symbols and primitive mnemonics (notches, knots, quipus, marked stones and columns, family staffs, spears and banners for investiture), showing how such concrete signs substituted for documents; it closes as the discussion moves from mnemonic devices toward the emergence of pictographic writing.

{"76878": "\"Von Sonnen und Sonnenst\u00e4ubchen :  Kosmische Wanderungen\" by Wilhelm B\u00f6lsche is a collection of popular-science essays written in the early 20th century. The volume ranges across astronomy, geology, evolution, and animal life, blending travel vignette, philosophy, and clear exposition to make modern science vivid to general readers. Its unifying theme is a human-scaled tour through cosmic and natural history, from suns to \u201csun-dust,\u201d showing how scientific facts cohere into a larger, poetic vision of the world.  The opening of the volume begins with a preface that calls Earth and humanity \u201csun-dust\u201d and states the aim of throwing clarifying light onto the heaped \u201cdust\u201d of modern facts so they shine as a unified whole. It then follows a night hike in the Riesengebirge, where a tear in the fog reveals the Milky Way and sparks a sweeping meditation from ancient myth and medieval spheres to the Age of Discovery, Copernican astronomy, Newtonian law, energy conservation, geological deep time, and evolutionary ascent. Using striking analogies\u2014the Berlin city map to scale the solar system, and a coin\u2019s edge to explain why the Milky Way appears as a bright band\u2014the narrative reviews ideas from Democritus, Dante, Copernicus, Galileo, Bruno, Newton, Robert Mayer, Kant, Herschel, Humboldt, Kirchhoff, Bunsen, Draper, and Scheiner. It separates gaseous nebulae within our stellar system from true \u201cisland universes\u201d and, via spectroscopy (Fraunhofer lines) and photography, argues that the Andromeda nebula is a distant star system beyond our own, before turning to the pitfalls of perception and the newly fixed shapes of nebulae, leading toward the famous Ring Nebula.

{"76879": "De erfenis eener moeder by P. J. Andriessen is a didactic juvenile novel written in the late 19th century. It follows an Amsterdam family that falls from comfort into straitened circumstances, focusing on the steadfast daughter Hel\u00e8ne, her cheerful brother Rudolf, and the moral contrast with his principled schoolfriend Ernst; the \u201cinheritance\u201d of the title is less money than the mother\u2019s values of duty, prudence, and kindness.  The opening of the novel sets its moral tone with a preface calling it a simple family story for youth. We first see Rudolf at boarding school beside the honorable Ernst, who refuses to borrow for a rowing excursion, while Rudolf enjoys a lively outing and, later, a glittering dance at his uncle\u2019s house where their delicate mother\u2019s frailty is noted. The family\u2019s fortunes abruptly collapse: Mr. Nederhorst loses his wealth, friends fall away, and plans are made\u2014Rudolf remains at school, Leonie goes to an uncle, while Hel\u00e8ne stays with her ailing mother to help. Their loyal old servant Trui insists on serving without wages, and the family leaves Amsterdam for modest lodgings in Weesp, where Hel\u00e8ne assumes household duties and tends the younger children. In this new setting she meets the kindly widower Dr. Faminga, who offers sympathy and measured support, visits her mother, and quietly marks Hel\u00e8ne\u2019s sixteenth birthday with a thoughtful gift\u2014hinting at benevolence and the strengthening of character that will guide the story.

{"76880": "\"The Monist, Vol. 2, 1891-1892 : A quarterly magazine\" by Various is a philosophical and scientific periodical written in the late 19th century. It gathers essays, debates, correspondence, and reviews that probe logic, monism, psychology, jurisprudence, religion, politics, and the relation between science and philosophy. Readers can expect rigorous arguments about how knowledge is formed, how law and society evolve, and how contemporary political forces shape public life.  The opening of the volume moves from a major study of logic to essays on ethics, law, and U.S. politics. The first essay argues that modern science\u2019s success contrasts with a crisis of intellectual authority, criticizes formal and purely inductive logic, and defends a \u201ctranscendental\u201d approach that treats thought as the evolving meaning of facts, urging a rapprochement between science and a critical logic akin to Hegel\u2019s. Next comes a probing analysis of will and reason, rejecting the idea that reason is merely prohibitive or mere calculation, challenging hedonism and empty maxims, and proposing that \u201creasonable\u201d action expresses a coherent scheme of life shaped by dominant, organizing ideas. A third piece outlines ethnological jurisprudence: extending legal study to all peoples (especially so\u2011called primitive societies), identifying cross\u2011cultural legal parallels (e.g., marriage by capture, blood\u2011vengeance, ordeals), and using them to reconstruct the early development of law and to ground a new, comparative philosophy of law. The section on American politics depicts parties, machines, and voting blocs, explains race and immigration dynamics, shows how capital, patronage, and bribery distort elections, and yet points to reforms like the Australian ballot and to the healthy tension between centralizing and decentralizing forces as signs of democratic resilience.

Readers encounter debates over chance versus necessity, the relation of mind and matter, education and national thought, and contemporary European intellectual currents.  The opening of the volume presents Charles S. Peirce\u2019s \u201cMan\u2019s Glassy Essence,\u201d which argues for absolute chance and continuity, critiques rigid atomic impenetrability, applies the virial theorem, and proposes a molecular account of protoplasm to bridge physical processes with feeling and habit\u2014casting natural laws as habits of mind and suggesting general ideas can function like shared or \u201ccorporate\u201d personalities. Next, E. D. Cope\u2019s \u201cThe Future of Thought in America\u201d warns that isolation, conformity to majority opinion, and political timidity threaten intellectual progress, urging stronger ideals, freer criticism, and better leadership in education and the press, with churches serving as imperfect but vital carriers of ideals. Felix L. Oswald\u2019s \u201cMental Mummies\u201d attributes persistent religious conservatism to hereditary and historical habit, explaining why cultures differ in receptivity to reform. Alfred Binet\u2019s \u201cThe Nervous Ganglia of Insects\u201d inaugurates a detailed anatomical program using sections and comparative anatomy, outlining the structure of the prothoracic ganglion (ventral columns, dorsal lobe, connective filaments, crural nerves) to relate neural architecture to locomotor function.

{"76882": "\"The life and times of the Rev. John Wesley, M.A., founder of the Methodists.\u2026.\" by Rev. L. Tyerman is a historical biography written in the late 19th century. It chronicles John Wesley\u2019s later years and the expansion of Methodism through his travels, letters, sermons, and conferences, highlighting disputes over Calvinism, Christian perfection, and adherence to the Church of England. Drawing on journals and correspondence, it shows how Wesley organized and financed the movement while extending its reach in Britain and abroad.  The opening of the volume concentrates on 1768, tracing Wesley at 65 through conciliatory exchanges with Whitefield and Berridge, counsel to Lady Huntingdon, the sermon \u201cThe Good Steward,\u201d and an energetic tour from Chatham to the North and into Scotland preaching to soldiers and vast crowds. It presents his belief in supernatural testimony (via the Sunderland apparition case), firm advocacy of Christian perfection without separating from the Church, and a stream of pointed letters (to Fletcher, his brother Charles, and critics like Thomas Adam). It prints his 1768 will and recounts the Bristol Conference\u2014framed by his urgent dash to visit his ailing wife\u2014which set policies on preachers trading, revived field and early-morning preaching, enforced discipline, fasting, and pastoral visitation. The narrative also touches overseas beginnings through Laurence Coughlan\u2019s work in Newfoundland, the Oxford student expulsions and ensuing pamphlet war, and the opening of Lady Huntingdon\u2019s Trevecca college. Throughout, decisions about chapels (such as retaining Spitalfields), burdensome debts, and even congregational singing reveal the practical strains of a rapidly growing movement.

Around him gather vivid working-class figures\u2014Hanne, her mother, the feckless Pipmanden, and the idealistic Morten\u2014framing a story of solidarity, love, and social struggle.  The opening of the novel plunges us into the tenement known as \u201cArken,\u201d a damp courtyard world of children\u2019s games, sewer-breath, and the flute of the haunted Vinslev. Pelle appears as a generous, curious newcomer to the city, delivering piecework, witnessing a confused worker protest and police pushback, and\u2014spurred by a boss\u2019s anti-union warning\u2014joining the fragile shoemakers\u2019 union. He reunites with Morten, who gives him a stirring view of the city and of workers\u2019 power, and then spends an evening amid the Arken\u2019s neighbors, drawn to Hanne\u2019s teasing warmth. The next day brings comic misery (his trousers pawned by Pipmanden), a rescue by friendly neighbors, and an excursion to Dyrehaven: sunlight, forest, and a mass socialist rally that intoxicates Pelle while Hanne drifts into a trance-like fascination with a striking stranger; later, in a dance tent, Pelle jealously wards the man off, and the trio returns, the bond between Pelle and Hanne both tender and uncertain.

It follows Eustace Thorburn, a brilliant but nameless young man whose mother\u2019s death drives him to uncover his parentage and avenge her wrongs. Running alongside is a high-society thread about Harold Jerningham, his estranged wife Emily, and editor Laurence Desmond, whose Platonic attachment to Emily tests public decorum and private feeling. The book explores identity, ambition, seduction, and reputation across quiet Belgian canals and London\u2019s drawing rooms.  At the start of the novel, Eustace teaches in serene Villebrumeuse until a black-edged letter summons his grief: his mother is dead, and he vows to confront the unknown father who abandoned her.

It contrasts a jaded aristocrat\u2019s disillusion with the bright hopes of youth, entwining a potential cross-class romance with sharp glimpses of London\u2019s theatrical world and social pretenses. The story centers on Harold Jerningham, the weary owner of Greenlands; Eustace Thorburn, an idealistic young secretary; Helen de Bergerac, his amiable pupil; and editor Laurence Desmond, whose path crosses that of struggling actress Lucy Alford. Themes of ambition, jealousy, friendship, and the bitter aftertaste of pleasure run beneath a refined country-house drama and a gritty city subplot.  The opening of the novel follows Jerningham\u2019s return to his neglected estate on his birthday, where he meets Eustace reading Plato and then visits his old friend, M. de Bergerac, and Helen at the Grange. Sensing a mutual attraction between Helen and Eustace, Jerningham questions the wisdom of housing a handsome, gifted secretary so close to the innocent heiress, while De Bergerac defends the young man\u2019s honour and usefulness to his scholarly work.

Themes of illegitimacy, honour, jealousy, and the friction between feeling and propriety drive the characters toward painful choices.  The opening of the novel follows Eustace as he reads a damning memoir (\u201cDisappointments of Dion\u201d) that lays bare his mother\u2019s abandonment by a selfish lover and hints at a Scottish tie that could legitimize her union; shaken by a chance likeness and encounter with Harold Jerningham, he resolves to consult family, seek the Scottish scene, and leave to make his own name before daring to court Helen de Bergerac. The scene then shifts to River Lawn, where Emily Jerningham becomes benefactress to Lucy after her father\u2019s death, while Laurence, who brought Lucy help, keeps a strained distance.

{"76888": "\"Before the Most Holy = (Coram Sanctissimo)\" by Mother Mary Loyola is a collection of Catholic devotional meditations written in the early 20th century. Centered on Eucharistic adoration, it offers intimate, practical guidance for \u201cvisits\u201d to the Blessed Sacrament and for cultivating a living friendship with Christ present in the tabernacle. Mixing brief prose meditations with occasional verse, it encourages praise, contrition, thanksgiving, and confident petition, especially amid distraction and spiritual dryness.  The opening of the work frames the practice historically through an editor\u2019s preface, noting how visits to the Blessed Sacrament developed gradually and explaining that the book\u2019s aim is to help ordinary people pray simply and sincerely. The first chapters then model conversational prayer: urging frequent, affectionate visits to Jesus, translating everyday concerns into dialogue with Him, and welcoming readers to bring worries, defeats, and small victories to His Heart. Themes include praise in trial, readiness to share Christ\u2019s chalice (\u201cPossumus\u201d), His desire for companionship in the tabernacle, bringing practical cares into prayer (\u201cWhat things?\u201d), trust in faith over feelings, resilience after failure and gratitude after grace, and the courage to follow truth. Interwoven poems and reflections move through neglect, night adoration, Divine providence, the lavish \u201cimprovidence\u201d of Eucharistic love, inner transformation, darkness and dereliction met with filial trust, the gravity of His Second Coming, and a final turn to see the world sanctified by Christ\u2019s hidden Presence.

A treat of poffertjes turns sour when Puck abandons Frits and Lientien to sit with those friends, earning a stern talking\u2011to; soon after, an April Fools joke on Lientien ends in slaps before their father restores peace with a walk and pastries. The family then confronts a serious worry: the mother\u2019s eyesight, with a professor\u2019s advice leading to a new household arrangement in which Nel takes over many duties and Kee tends Aunt Sjarlotje, while Frits quietly dreams of becoming an eye doctor. Puck, having eavesdropped, panics and alarms Lientien before the truth is calmly set right, and a new helper, the industrious (and insatiably hungry) Geertje from Scheveningen, joins the busy home.

{"76891": "\"The accomplishment ratio :  A treatment of the inherited determinants of\u2026.\" by Raymond Franzen is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. It examines disparities in school achievement through standardized testing and statistical analysis, proposing the \u201cAccomplishment Ratio\u201d to judge how well students\u2019 actual progress aligns with their intellectual potential. The study focuses on how classification, measurement, and targeted instruction can raise achievement to match measured intelligence, probing whether differences in school performance are inherited or shaped by schooling.  The opening of the work lays out the rationale for replacing opinion with standardized measurement in schools and defines a toolkit of indices: Intelligence Quotient (IQ), Subject Quotients (SQ), Subject Ratios (SR), and their average, the Accomplishment Ratio (AccR). It explains how age norms are derived via regressions of score on age (with corrections for truncation) and then details the Garden City experiment: 200 pupils were tested with Binet, Thorndike reading and vocabulary, Woody-McCall arithmetic, and Kelley-Trabue language; students were reclassified by subject ability using \u201crelation sheets,\u201d regrouped for instruction, and \u201cpushed\u201d until their SQs approached their IQs. The procedures include precise scoring-to-age conversions, ongoing regrading by subject, and using AccR as a fairer, intelligence-referenced school mark for teachers and parents. Early statistical results show that, under special treatment, subject quotients move toward IQ and correlations strengthen across grades, suggesting intelligence is the primary driver of achievement while remaining disparities likely reflect schooling mismatches rather than distinct inherited special abilities.

It centers on a student-run railroad and an escalating rivalry between the Toppleton Institute and the Wimpleton Academy along Lake Ucayga. The story follows Wolf Penniman, a level-headed young engineer, alongside the imperious Tommy Toppleton and the reckless Waddie Wimpleton, as schoolboy politics, railroading, and military-style drills spark real-world tensions. Themes of leadership, pride, and moral duty frame the spirited contests between the two academies.  The opening of the novel unfolds at a noisy stockholders\u2019 meeting of the student-managed Lake Shore Railroad, where Tommy Toppleton\u2019s heavy-handed presidency faces a revolt. After a procedural tussle, the boys adjourn to Grass Springs for an election and a celebratory supper; Tommy is humiliatingly voted out on the first ballot, restored on a second only because his rival, Skotchley, refuses the office. The students then choose the Horse Shoe island for their annual encampment\u2014largely to needle their Wimpleton rivals\u2014and prepare a rapid march. Wolf, urged by Major Toppleton to \u201ckeep the peace,\u201d helps expedite transport, but at Grass Springs the Wimpleton flotilla blocks the channel. Tommy rashly orders a steamer to force passage; Wolf and the captain try to avoid harm, yet Waddie leads a bold boarding that seizes the forward deck, locks Company B below, and stops the engine. With the steamer captured and tempers high, Waddie tries to coerce Wolf into running the machinery, setting the stage for a dangerous standoff. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}

The opening of this manual distinguishes artistic embroidery from pattern-filling \u201cfancy work,\u201d urging the worker to design, choose materials, and stitch as one, to favor simplified forms suited to the needle, and to prize durability. It then treats worsted embroidery\u2014especially crewel\u2014giving the crewel stitch, shading and leaf direction, suitable motifs and grounds, and many project ideas (friezes, dados, porti\u00e8res, screens, table covers, wraps). A concise color primer explains harmonious pairings, key-note schemes, and how ground and light affect tints. The section on silk embroidery introduces frames and hand positions, the principal long stitch, and allied stitches (satin, French knots, stalk, point-russe, herring-bone, chain, ladder), with patterns and notes on Chinese and Japanese styles. Next come designing and transferring methods (tracing, pouncing, chalk), followed by example pieces in silk\u2014from peacock-feather and banner screens to dress panels, fans, furniture covers, and a child\u2019s afghan. The opening also outlines print-work (engraving-like monochrome), mixing silk with gold (passing, cord, braid, bullion, spangles, gold thread, with heraldic cautions), embroidered bookbindings and small leather goods, and begins appliqu\u00e9 with its methods and patterns for borders and lambrequins.

Set in a rural community hall, it lightly satirizes small-town militia drilling, poking fun at bluster, incompetence, and local pride during volunteer military exercises.  The action unfolds on a summer Sunday at the village hall stage. Herttuala, the janitor, readies the space while the pompous, big-bellied merchant Mallinen takes charge, soon joined by the sleepy Virsil\u00e4, the jovial baker Kekkeri, and the farmer Torppala.

Expect passionate conflicts, vivid landscapes, and swift, unsettling turns.  The opening of the collection presents Lute demanding that Chris explain why he cannot marry her, even as he professes deep love and insists he must remain silent.

{"76900": "\"Race and nationality by Franz Boas\" is a scholarly essay in anthropology and social thought written in the early 20th century. The work challenges popular beliefs about race and nationalism, arguing that supposed racial instincts and pure racial types are myths, that nationality rests on shared culture more than blood or language, and that humanity should move toward a federation of nations.  The essay rejects the idea that Europe\u2019s conflict is a war of races, showing that physical types and ancestries are widely mixed and do not match national borders or languages. It dismantles the blond Aryan myth, finds no evidence for the inferiority of mixed populations, and explains that what we call race often masks national habit and sentiment. Nationality, it argues, grows from common habits, feelings, and political life; language can aid it but is not essential, as shown by places like Belgium and Switzerland, and even polyglot empires can develop shared civic ideals. While acknowledging nationalism\u2019s creative role in enlarging the individual\u2019s field of action, the essay warns against its aggressive, expansionist misuse in pan-movements. Tracing social evolution from small hordes to nations, it proposes the next step: a federation of nations with common aims, surpassing mere arbitration. It concludes that education should temper patriotic fervor with international ethics, and that war is defensible only to protect the integrity of essential ideals, not to impose one nation\u2019s will on others.

{"76901": "\"Birth Control Laws: Shall We Keep Them, Change Them, or Abolish Them\" by Mary Ware Dennett is a public-policy treatise written in the early 20th century. It scrutinizes how U.S. federal and state statutes born of \u201cComstockery\u201d restrict access to contraceptive information, and weighs whether these laws should be retained, modified, or repealed. The work maps the legal framework, recounts its origins, and considers practical and ethical consequences for families, physicians, and public institutions.  The opening of the treatise sets its scope: it will not argue the merits of birth control itself, but will examine the laws that govern access to contraceptive knowledge and how those laws should change. Dennett outlines the book\u2019s structure and then, through vivid examples\u2014a mother\u2019s letter to her daughter, a doctor-to-doctor exchange, and a lawmaker\u2019s private plea\u2014shows how federal statutes make even basic advice a crime. She summarizes key federal provisions and parallel state measures, highlighting their conflation of contraception with obscenity and abortion, peculiar extremes like Connecticut\u2019s ban on use, and New York\u2019s narrow medical carveout that enabled a clinic. The author defines birth control as prevention of conception (not abortion), exposes the absurdity of criminalizing knowledge but not its use, and illustrates distribution barriers that persist even in states without explicit bans, as seen in the Chicago clinic fight. Turning to origins, she describes the bill\u2019s rushed passage in Congress under Anthony Comstock\u2019s influence, the removal of an early physician exemption, and the unique American practice of classing contraceptive science with indecency, alongside Comstock\u2019s methods, mindset, and critics. She notes that enforcement has been sporadic and often selective\u2014citing politicized cases and light penalties\u2014underscoring official inconsistency and the practical unenforceability of the laws.

It then outlines the book\u2019s breadth via a detailed contents list and a plan of the fortress, before Chapter I gives a close, almost architectural tour of the Bastile\u2014its courts, towers, dungeons, rooms, meagre furnishings, food allowances and abuses, the tiny library, and chapel niches\u2014alongside an explanation of lettres de cachet, their uses and abuses, and the secrecy that shrouded arrests, correspondence, illness, death, and burial. Vivid particulars include corrupt provisioning, the suppression of letters, bans on tools and even compasses, night-time isolation, medical delays, refusal to permit wills, and the masking of identities after death; a first-person narrative of an eight-month inmate illustrates the routine of arrest, processing, confinement, limited exercise, controlled reading, and ultimate release with none of his letters delivered. Chapter II begins the chronological history: the term \u201cBastile,\u201d early Paris bastiles, the founding efforts of Stephen Marcel and later enlargements by Hugh Aubriot (whose downfall to university and clerical hostility and brief liberation during a popular rising are recounted), then political imprisonments under Charles VI, including Noviant and La Rivi\u00e8re, the fall of Montaigu, and the factional struggle between Burgundians and Armagnacs centered in Paris.

Expect a focus on his early formation, Parisian ascent, key relationships, and the aesthetic of refined melancholy that defines his art.  The opening of this biography sets Chopin against the luminous foil of Liszt and the fate of Poland, then follows him from a protected Warsaw childhood through precocious studies with Zywny and Elsner, first publications, and early acclaim. It traces his awakening sensibility\u2014captured in the untranslatable Polish zal\u2014his youthful love for the singer Constance Gladkowska, and his conflicted departure from Warsaw on the eve of revolution.

The tone is appreciative and informative, with itinerary-style routes and a keen eye for everyday details.

The opening of the work follows the author\u2019s cramped voyage on the brig Francis to San Juan de Nicaragua (Greytown), a tense bar crossing that nearly wrecks the ship, and his first close look at a palm-thatched port under British consular control. He sketches vivid street scenes\u2014mixed races, cigar\u2011smoking women in naguas and guipils, hammocks in doorways, lagoons alive with alligators and snakes, and a comical equality among pigs, babies, dogs, and chickens\u2014alongside visits with a courteous local host and the ailing British consul.

Readers encounter mythic invocations, historical portraits, and moral allegories that link ancient heroism to modern conscience.  The opening of the collection contrasts the old war\u2011glorifying muse with a new muse of peace, then defends scientific courage through the story of Halley, mocked for foretelling a comet that duly returns.

{"76908": "\"Sul libro degli ultimi casi di Romagna e sulle speranze d''Italia fondate su\u2026.\" is a polemical political pamphlet written in the mid-19th century. Framed as an open letter to Massimo d\u2019Azeglio, it rebuts moderate counsels with a fiery defense of Italian uprisings, denounces contemporary rulers as tyrants, and argues that independence has been amply earned through long suffering and sacrifice. The work attacks the papal regime, the Bourbon monarchy in Naples, and above all Carlo Alberto and aristocratic \u201cmoderates,\u201d contending that cautious protest is futile under censorship and police repression. Its likely focus is to justify insurrection in Romagna as a national, not provincial, effort and to rally Italians toward unity, leadership, and decisive action.  The opening of \"Sul libro degli ultimi casi di Romagna e sulle speranze d''Italia fondate su\u2026.\" addresses d\u2019Azeglio directly, explaining the writer\u2019s reluctant but compelled reply to his book on Romagna and his \u201chopes\u201d in Carlo Alberto. Osservazione I rejects the claim that the age of tyrants is over, naming the Pope, the Duke of Modena, the King of Naples, and Carlo Alberto as present-day despots who imprison without trial; it defends Alfieri\u2019s vehement language. Osservazione II disputes the idea that speaking freely is safe, citing censorship, surveillance, and even the constrained circulation of d\u2019Azeglio\u2019s own volume, while skewering aristocratic moderates like Balbo and lamenting theatrical muzzling. Osservazione III asserts Italy has long merited freedom, cataloging centuries of invasions and current abuses; Osservazione IV defends revolt as morally noble regardless of outcome and faults d\u2019Azeglio\u2019s contradictions. Osservazione V denies Italian egoism and municipalism, casting partial uprisings as sparks for a national blaze and calling for a leader and discreet propaganda; Osservazione VI rejects equating rebels with princes, urging resistance over resigned suffering. Osservazione VII mocks the notion of asking the Papal State to be \u201cmore despotic\u201d and castigates Carlo Alberto\u2019s betrayals; Osservazione VIII argues that open protests are useless and dangerous, offering anecdotes and beginning to cite the great powers\u2019 ignored reform memorandum to Rome.

{"76909": "\"Vanhojen neitien talo :  Kertomus pyhimyksist\u00e4 ja sankareista\" by Sven Lidman is a novel written in the early 20th century. Set around a decaying Stockholm townhouse nicknamed \u201cNelonen,\u201d it portrays a small circle of aging gentlewomen whose lives and quarrels play out against a city\u2019s march toward modernity and wealth. The story centers on the imperious Rosalie Pistolschi\u00f6ld, the pinched and acquisitive Emma Wigelstjerna, the fragile and grieving Eurydike Berg, and the more hesitant Marie-Louise Almgren. Through sharp portraits and moral reflections, it contrasts aristocratic pride, petty bourgeois habits, and wounded romanticism with the hard edges of contemporary urban life.  The opening of the novel moves from brief meditations on truth and the schooling of the heart to a vivid, almost panoramic description of the old house on Malmberg Street and its disdainful, modern neighbors. We learn how a binding testament keeps the building untouched and shelters three elderly women in the top floor, marking it as a stubborn relic amid speculation and progress. The narrative then sketches the tenants: Rosalie (\u201cPistooli\u201d) rises at dawn, inspects the courtyard and stables like a commander, and recalls a ceremonious upbringing under her punctilious court-official father; Emma\u2019s backstory reveals a fussy, tightly managed childhood, a life devoted to furniture and propriety, and her calculated move into the house that sparks friction with Rosalie; finally, Eurydike appears in a dim, flower-crowded room, her hush contrasting the city\u2019s glare, as her past unfolds\u2014widowhood, children lost at sea, and roots in an old industrial-huguenot line\u2014before the narrative breaks off.

The magazine ranges widely: it opens with a detailed account of Rome\u2019s Colosseum, its scale, engineering, and bloody spectacles, framed by Montaigne\u2019s vivid observations and a moral critique of cruelty. It then analyzes the circulation of the Spectator and the impact of stamp duties; explains how to gauge a horse\u2019s age by its teeth; and traces tobacco\u2019s spread into Europe alongside clerical and royal attempts to suppress it. \u201cThe Week\u201d blends folklore (St. Swithin) with a compact life of Petrarch and Byron\u2019s tribute. An essay by Dr. Percival argues that a taste for nature refines the morals and elevates piety.

{"76911": "\"Good-bye to all that :  An autobiography\" by Robert Graves is an autobiography written in the early 20th century. It charts Graves\u2019s life from a precocious, book-filled childhood through elite English schooling and toward the disillusionments that frame his farewell to the society, institutions, and loyalties that shaped him, with war and literary life looming as central arenas of experience.  The opening of this autobiography sets out Graves\u2019s blunt aims\u2014farewell, forgetfulness, and money\u2014before moving swiftly into vivid, unsentimental self-portraiture and family origins. He sketches early memories and a wry \u201cpassport\u201d description of his body and temperament, then unfolds a double inheritance: a principled, learned German maternal line (von Ranke) and a wordy, clerical Anglo-Irish paternal line (Graves), each supplying traits and tensions he will struggle with. He recalls strict Protestant upbringing, class awareness sharpened in a fever hospital, and a household of servants bridged by a beloved nurse, alongside a developing horror of Catholic imagery and a long, crippling fear of sin and sex. Schooling dominates: a carousel of preparatory schools\u2014from canings and scandal to first literary discipline\u2014culminates in a scholarship to Charterhouse, where poverty, \u201cvon\u201d in his name, and prudish innocence invite bullying amid a culture of games, romanticized homosociality, and cynicism. Counterbalancing this are luminous summers in Bavaria (castles, ghosts, rich food) and a deep attachment to the austere Welsh hills, where he trains himself out of fear. The section ends with his loathing for the public-school spirit, a postponed Oxford, and the turn to poetry as a private refuge. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}

Seeking more leads, he visits the Hall place at night, notes evasive answers from Captain Pete, and later joins Boy Scouts on an overnight at Twin Cedar Cabin near the Hall land, where large boot and dog tracks (and possibly smaller prints) suggest recent intruders and eerie lights flicker over reputed Indian graves.

Washed onto a colder land, the survivors must hunt, then, under Lasse\u2019s guidance, rediscover fire, salt, metals, herding, and farming; with these come property, taxes, hierarchy, war, and servitude, making Lasse a lawgiver while Peter leads a hunter faction that denounces the new agrarian life.

{"76935": "Walter Pater by Arthur Christopher Benson is a literary biography and critical study written in the early 20th century. It explores the life, temperament, and aesthetic philosophy of the Victorian critic Walter Pater, pairing narrative with close readings of his major works. The emphasis falls on Pater\u2019s Oxford career, his method of \u201cimaginative\u201d criticism, and the cultural ripple of his Renaissance studies.  The opening of the book explains the absence of an official life and how the author builds his account from Pater\u2019s sisters, friends, and published sources, then outlines the contents. It traces Pater\u2019s quiet, observant childhood, Canterbury schooldays, and early sensitivity to beauty and ritual, notes Keble\u2019s brief influence, and points to autobiographical threads in The Child in the House and Emerald Uthwart. At Oxford he reads Ruskin and German thinkers, takes a second in Greats, wins a Brasenose fellowship, and\u2014after Italy and Winckelmann\u2014shifts decisively from metaphysics to art. The narrative dwells on his austere rooms, regular habits, gentle but exacting teaching of essays, and a circle that includes Shadwell, Bywater, Pattison, and the Wards. It then surveys the early writings\u2014Diaphaneit\u00e8, the Coleridge essay, and especially Studies in the History of the Renaissance\u2014summarizing key essays on Botticelli, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Giorgione, and Du Bellay, and the debated \u201cConclusion\u201d and its later revisions.

The opening of the manual states its purpose: to fill a practical gap by teaching physicians how to conduct post-mortems, what to look for, and how to recognize morbid changes. An introduction argues for the clinical and scientific importance of pathology and autopsy\u2014both to refine diagnosis and prognosis and to serve medico-legal needs\u2014followed by clear advice on instruments, room setup, hygiene precautions, timing, note-taking, and obtaining family consent. The preliminary chapter inventories a post-mortem kit and gives pragmatic guidance on protecting surroundings and oneself, then Part I begins with detailed operative procedures for opening the skull, examining the brain and base, removing the ear and eye for inspection, and exposing the spinal cord with minimal disfigurement. Early pathology sections survey skull injuries (including contre-coup fractures), bone disease, meningeal inflammation and effusions, and intracranial hemorrhage, supplemented by brief case vignettes of apoplexy and cerebral congestion. The text then sketches key brain diseases\u2014cerebritis, softening, abscess, induration, hypertrophy, atrophy\u2014common tumors and deposits, vascular obstruction and arterial degeneration, and parallel lesions of the spinal cord and its membranes.

{"76939": "\"The laws of contrast of colour : and their application to the arts of\u2026.\" by M. E. Chevreul is a scientific treatise written in the mid-19th century. It sets out a rigorous theory of how adjacent colours alter one another in hue and tone, and applies these principles to painting, textiles, printing, architecture, dress, horticulture, and even military uniforms. Expect experiments, diagrams, and practical rules intended to replace vague \u201ctaste\u201d with clear methods for creating harmonious and effective colour arrangements.  The opening of the treatise moves from prefatory material into a clear statement of purpose: to explain and prove the law of simultaneous contrast and show its uses. After noting complaints about dyes at the Gobelins that led to his discovery, the author introduces the composition of white light and the idea of complementary colours, then defines simultaneous contrast (changes in both hue and tone when colours are seen side by side) and demonstrates it with simple paper-strip experiments. He formulates the general law\u2014that adjacent colours appear as different as possible\u2014derives its consequences with many colour pairs, and examines effects against white, black, and grey, stressing that chemical makeup of pigments doesn\u2019t alter the optical result. He distinguishes simultaneous, successive, and mixed contrast and shows practical pitfalls (e.g., how viewing one colour biases judgment of the next), then begins the applications by defining tones, scales, and hues, proposing a chromatic diagram, outlining harmonies of analogy and contrast, and offering early guidance on assortments\u2014especially colours with white and complementary pairings.

The work blends practical exploration logistics with ethnographic observation and reflections on missionary prospects and trade.  The opening of the book sets out the aims and scope of the journey: to fill a blank on the map between the Cape Colony and the Portuguese coast up toward Lake \u2019Ngami, with first reports on the Damaras, Hottentots, and the agriculturally adept Ovampo, and a case for Ondonga as a promising, healthy base for missions and trade. Galton explains why explorations advance step by step, outlines his dates and routes, and then narrates how Boer unrest blocked the usual Bechuana approach, pushing him to choose Walfisch Bay with missionary support. He details preparations\u2014wagons, mules, pack-oxen, barter goods, servants, and dogs\u2014followed by a stark landfall on the mirage-haunted coast, brackish wells at Sand Fountain, tobacco as currency, and the novelty of ride-oxen. Moving inland to Scheppmansdorf, he describes the mission layout and a tense series of lion encounters culminating in killing a notorious cattle-raider, then breaks in pack-oxen, distributes loads, and begins the desert crossing to the Swakop; there, heat, thirst, and a misjudged decision to leave stock unattended lead to lions taking a mule and a horse, a failed nocturnal ambush, and a sobering, reduced push onward.

Along the way it touches on censorship under the Commonwealth, impressment and seamen\u2019s grievances, and the texture of shipboard culture\u2014music, dancing, and forecastle songs\u2014culminating in notes on stage and patriotic pieces sailors adopted, such as D\u2019Urfey\u2019s sea song and Purcell\u2019s \u201cBritons, strike home.\u201d (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}

{"76943": "\"Muistoja ja kuvitelmia\" by Aino Ackt\u00e9 is a collection of memoiristic essays and imaginative vignettes written in the early 20th century. It blends autobiographical recollection with symbolic tales and dreamlike scenes to explore art, love, fame, jealousy, fate, and the ache of longing from a celebrated singer\u2019s perspective. The pieces move fluidly between real encounters and lyrical allegories, tracing how memory and imagination shape an artist\u2019s inner life.  The opening of the collection moves from a striking dream about a snake-filled cup of envy to a heated affair between an actress and a writer that dims once physical passion erodes spiritual kinship. A gallery of rings becomes a treasury of memories\u2014queens, mentors, a faithful childhood caretaker, and a poet\u2014while meditations on love show devotion surviving disillusion. Consolation arrives through music and poetry as \u201cthe souls of the dead\u201d speak, followed by parables of missed courage and punishing fate, and an image (Faleron\u2019s angel) that rekindles the will to create. Other sketches show inspiration bound to sorrow, an exuberant hymn to the gramophone jump-starting a triumphant concert, and two contrasting unions: a marriage that withers and a free bond that, paradoxically, endures. Brief pieces portray a smile that persists even as photographs burn, a lovers\u2019 plunge through snow to unite beyond judgment, and a wealthy woman\u2019s inborn unrest. The section closes in a Paris studio, where a renowned painter claims to capture purity wrestling with desire in a portrait, as the narrative breaks off mid-thought.

{"76944": "\"Dostoevsky\" by Andr\u00e9 Gide is a work of literary criticism and biographical essays written in the early 20th century. It probes the life, thought, and artistry of Fyodor Dostoevsky, arguing for his primacy as a psychologist and moral visionary whose fiction wrestles with inner, spiritual conflicts rather than merely social ones. The focus is on how Dostoevsky\u2019s characters embody living problems\u2014religious, ethical, and existential\u2014rendered with vivid humanity rather than abstract doctrine.  The opening of this study presents Arnold Bennett\u2019s introduction praising Gide\u2019s insight and situating the book as a landmark in understanding Russian psychology, followed by a translator\u2019s note explaining its origins as 1922 lectures and the sources quoted. Gide\u2019s preface defends Dostoevsky against Western charges of irrationality, stressing his concern with the individual\u2019s relation to self and God, the lifelike fluidity of his characters, and the uncompromising labor behind his art. In a long section drawn from correspondence, Gide sketches Dostoevsky\u2019s aversion to letter-writing, lifelong poverty, humility in begging for help, ferocious work ethic and revisions, debilitating epilepsy, gambling and debts, intense family duties, and a worldview mixing Russian nationalism with a universal mission, Orthodoxy with a Christ-centered humanism, and individualism joined to self-sacrifice\u2014all of which left him outside parties and programs. At the start of the addresses, Gide contrasts Rousseau\u2019s self-conscious pose with Dostoevsky\u2019s unposed humility, then recounts the youthful bohemian years, arrest in the Petrashevsky affair, mock execution, and Siberian exile, quoting letters that vividly depict the journey, brutal prison conditions, and the convict\u2019s resilient hope and compassion he both received and offered.

The tales lean toward the supernatural and domestic melodrama, exploring jealousy, guilt, and the persistence of wronged affections beyond the grave. Early standouts feature a complacent publisher haunted by a former lover he mistreated, and a London doctor whose rural retreat turns into a study in uncanny repetition and family tragedy.  The opening of this collection follows Mr. Sigismund Braggett, a newly married publisher who once encouraged the hopes of an eager \u201cauthoress,\u201d Charlotte Cray. After Charlotte dies, Braggett\u2019s clerks, his household, and finally his wife encounter her presence; the apparition appears in his office before dissolving, prompting him to abandon business, knowing Charlotte has kept her vow to \u201csee\u201d his wife.

It showcases the author as biographer, translator, critic, and royalist controversialist.

The opening of the volume frames the context of the 1680s English Plutarch with an editor\u2019s note and a bookseller\u2019s advertisement, then unveils a lofty dedication to the Duke of Ormond. In that dedication, the writer contrasts ancient greatness with modern decline, praises Ormond\u2019s fidelity and governance of Ireland, castigates sectaries, republicans, and inconstant ex-royalists, and defends honest history against bigotry and partisan fabrication. It then proceeds to the Life of Plutarch, sketching his birth at Ch\u00e6ronea, family and teacher Ammonius, the humane cast of Greek education, his travels and relentless collection of sources, and his temperate, sociable character. The narrative outlines his Platonic-leaning philosophy, his ideas on oracles and intermediary spirits, his marriage to Timoxena and children, his Roman connections (notably Sossius Senecio and Trajan), and his likely public employments.

David then describes refitting the Morrissey, introducing the crew, gear, and radio, and their celebratory send\u2011off from Long Island Sound before rough weather, seasickness, and thunderstorms on the run to Nova Scotia and through the Strait of Belle Isle, where they meet their first icebergs and pack\u2011ice. After shipboard lectures, films, and ice navigation drills, they reach Greenland: at Holsteinsborg they land Professor Hobbs for glacial studies, trade and film, then move on to Disko (Godhavn) and Proven to barter for kamiks, ivory carvings, and model kayaks while avoiding taking essentials. In Upernivik they watch expert kayak\u2011rolling (and see Robert Peary Jr. dunked), help feed sled dogs, and visit eider\u2011duck islands to gather down, eggs, and specimens amid traces of old whalers. Crossing Melville Bay unusually easily, they water from a glacier at Cape York, trade for a kayak, net little auks, stalk seals, and rope down sea cliffs for eggs and nests.

{"76954": "\"The history of the Norman conquest of England, its causes and its results,\u2026.\" by Edward A. Freeman is a historical account written in the late 19th century. It presents a comprehensive, source-based narrative of how Norman power rose and reshaped England, examining causes, principal actors, conflicts, and lasting effects. This volume focuses on the reign of Eadward the Confessor and the early years of William of Normandy, charting the political contest between English and Norman interests before open war in 1066. Readers can expect close chronology, institutional context, and sharply drawn portraits of Godwine, Harold, and Eadward that set the stage for the Conquest.  The opening of this history outlines a five-volume plan: this volume covers the political struggle under Eadward the Confessor (1042\u20131051), a later one treats the campaigns of 1066, another William\u2019s rule in England, and a final volume the long-term results. After acknowledgments, the narrative begins with Eadward\u2019s popular election following Harthacnut\u2019s death, the unusual delay of his coronation (explained by his absence and hesitancy), and an embassy\u2014led by Godwine and Bishop Lyfing\u2014that persuades him to accept the crown. A Witenagemot at Gillingham faces resistance from partisans of Swend Estrithson, but Eadward is eventually crowned at Winchester amid embassies from Germany, France, and Norway; English magnates offer gifts, notably Godwine\u2019s splendid warship. The author then sketches Eadward\u2019s character: revered as a saint yet ill-suited to rule, conscientious but passive, prone to bursts of anger, fond of hunting, and inclined toward foreign favourites\u2014early signs of the Norman influence that grows under his reign.

{"76960": "\"The corsair; or, the little fairy at the bottom of the sea :  A new Christmas\u2026\" by William Brough is a comic burlesque pantomime from the mid-19th-century Victorian era. Built on the popular ballet Le Corsaire and winking at Byron\u2019s pirate romance, it mixes fairy spectacle, slapstick, and melodrama. Its likely topic is a swashbuckling pirate story turned into a playful Christmas entertainment in which love and magic try to reform a notorious corsair.  The plot follows Conrad, a moody pirate, whose fate becomes the business of sea-fairies led by Serena, who vows to redeem him through love. On shore he rescues the vivacious Medora from a slave market, then survives a fairy-made shipwreck, only to be betrayed by his lieutenant Birbanto, who helps the renegade Yussuf abduct Medora. Serena thwarts a mutiny, and Conrad infiltrates the Pasha\u2019s harem in disguise, duels Birbanto, and is captured. To save him, Medora pretends to accept the Pasha\u2019s proposal, while Gulnare cunningly marries the Pasha herself under a veil.

{"76961": "\"The literature of the Celts\" by Magnus Maclean is a scholarly survey of Celtic literary history written in the early 20th century. It introduces general readers to the origins, manuscripts, myths, saints, and revivals of Celtic writing, from Ogam stones and early Gaelic-Latin texts through monastic learning to saga cycles and their European influence. The work maps key sources, periods, and scholars, arguing for the richness and enduring significance of the Celtic tradition.  The opening of this study sets out the surge of modern interest in Celtic studies, citing Continental scholarship, Kuno Meyer\u2019s optimism, and Yeats\u2019s hopes for Celtic legend, before explaining the book\u2019s aim as a concise, popular guide distilled from university lectures. It then sketches, in Chapter I, the historical backdrop of the Celts in Europe, their migrations and conquests, the linguistic split between Gadelic (Q) and Brittonic (P) branches, classical testimony from Greek and Roman writers, and the eventual literary awakening marked by Ogam inscriptions, the adoption of the Roman script, and early monastic texts; it also notes that the earliest sustained Gaelic appears in glosses and marginalia on the Continent, and situates Celtic within the Aryan language family. Chapter II focuses on St. Patrick as the first clearly identifiable Celtic writer, recounting the reliable sources on his life, his captivity and call, and summarizing his surviving works\u2014the Latin \u201cConfession\u201d and \u201cEpistle to Coroticus,\u201d and the Gaelic lorica known as the \u201cDeer\u2019s Cry\u201d\u2014while acknowledging uncertain dates and later legendary dialogues.

Early focal figures include the defiant student Bernard Profitendieu, his sensitive friend Olivier Molinier, the literary uncle Edouard, and the calculating aristocrat Robert de Passavant.  The opening follows Bernard as he discovers a hidden letter proving his illegitimacy, coolly abandons his bourgeois home, and secretly spends the night in Olivier\u2019s room near the Luxembourg Gardens.

{"76966": "\"The phantom public\" by Walter Lippmann is a treatise on democratic theory written in the early 20th century. It argues that the omnicompetent, sovereign citizen imagined by democratic dogma does not exist, and that public opinion is intermittent, external to real decision-making, and best used to align force behind workable rules rather than to govern directly. The work reframes elections as mobilizations that substitute for civil war and proposes practical limits and responsibilities for the public\u2019s role in politics.  The opening of this work portrays a disengaged citizenry and uses evidence of widespread nonvoting to show that expecting the public to master complex affairs is unrealistic. It dismisses standard remedies\u2014better schooling, moral exhortation, more direct democracy, or socialization of industry\u2014as unable to produce an all-knowing public, and recasts citizens chiefly as bystanders whose votes align support rather than direct policy. It then sketches an ideal of public action: to neutralize arbitrary force, enable settlements by consent, and leave substantive problem-solving to those directly responsible, with government acting as a professional intermediary. Next, it defines \u201cproblems\u201d as disharmonies created by uneven change (illustrated by population pressure, automobiles in cities, naval ratios, and economic scarcity), and argues that rights and duties are enforceable promises shaping a workable modus vivendi. Finally, it says the public should ask only two questions\u2014whether a rule is defective and who can mend it\u2014using coarse tests of assent and conformity, insisting on open debate to expose special pleading, and, at scale, choosing between Ins and Outs when crises persist.

{"76967": "\"Princess Puck\" by Una L. Silberrad is a novel written in the early 20th century.

Around Bill orbit her poised cousin Theresa, Theresa\u2019s flawed farmer-husband Robert Morton, and the outsider-farmer Gilchrist Harborough, with clergy and local ladies shaping the social weather. It reads as a domestic and social coming-of-age, attentive to class, marriage, and the gap between ideal and ordinary human nature.  The opening of the story traces the decision to send Bill from Miss Brownlow\u2019s declining school in Wrugglesby to stay with the newly married Theresa at Ashelton. Bill\u2019s blunt conversations with schoolmates reveal her curiosity about men, marriage, and propriety, and her inner life is set against Theresa\u2019s tidy new household. At Haylands farm, Bill cheerfully throws herself into chores, while Robert Morton\u2019s drunken return from market\u2014managed discreetly by Bill with the help of neighbor Harborough\u2014introduces the first crack in Theresa\u2019s ideal marriage. Bill later debates Harborough about loyalty, weakness, and what wives can bear, and she begins to meet Ashelton society through a prayer-meeting led by the self-satisfied curate, tea visits with observant spinsters, and Sunday church with the shadowy Harborough family chapel. She mimics the curate in private, takes in the village\u2019s talk of old county families, and finds a county history bearing her grandmother\u2019s name.

{"76968": "\"Strau\u00dfenpolitik :  Neue Tierfabeln\" by Th. Zell is a collection of popular zoological essays written in the early 20th century. The work challenges common \u201canimal fables\u201d and anthropomorphic assumptions, replacing them with evidence-based explanations from natural history and field observation. It examines the adaptive logic behind animal form and behavior, from hippos and giraffes to predators, domesticates, and birds, arguing that utility, ecology, and risk\u2014not human-like motives\u2014drive what animals do. The tone is skeptical yet accessible, appealing to readers who enjoy myth-busting about the natural world.  The opening of the book sets the program: a brief foreword promises a continuation of earlier myth critiques, then the author refutes \u201cimprovers\u201d who claim nature botched the hippo and giraffe, showing why bulk, long legs, and browsing diets are advantageous and why zoo feeding misleads. He distinguishes shame from guilt, arguing animals likely lack shame but may show guilt or awareness, illustrated with dogs, goats, and an ape understanding consequences, while reinterpreting feline \u201cembarrassment\u201d as hunting limits or habit. He explains predators\u2019 caution toward humans as rational risk-avoidance given our unpredictable weapons, not awe of upright posture, and notes how hunger or infirmity yields man-eaters. He disputes that only herd animals can be domesticated, contrasting tameable solitary species (lynx, cheetah) with dangerous or impractical herd species, and stresses danger, temperament, and human utility as the real factors. He recasts equine \u201cnervousness\u201d as justified vigilance of fleeing herbivores shaped by predation, illustrated by zebras, deer startling at sudden events, and the contrasting boldness of defensive bovines. Finally, he questions claims that animals \u201cadmire themselves\u201d in mirrors, using a titmouse at a mirror to argue recognition is misread, before the discussion cuts off.

{"76972": "\"Mit\u00e4 on taide?\" by graf Leo Tolstoy is a philosophical treatise written in the late 19th century. It examines what art is, why it matters, and whom it should serve, sharply challenging the era\u2019s worship of \u201cbeauty\u201d and the prestige institutions of opera, ballet, museums, and criticism. The work pushes toward an ethical, socially grounded understanding of art rather than elite entertainment.  The opening of the work portrays a world saturated with arts coverage and lavishly funded cultural institutions, then contrasts this with the exhausting, demeaning labor behind a fashionable opera rehearsal\u2014petty tyrannies, empty spectacle, and a trivial, artificial plot\u2014while calling ballet\u2019s erotic display immoral. From there it asks who benefits from such \u201cart,\u201d whether its vast costs are justified, and why criticism is so contradictory. It questions the common identification of art with \u201cbeauty,\u201d noting how the term stretches absurdly to cooking, dress, and even smell and touch, and then surveys a cacophony of aesthetic theories (from Baumgarten and Winckelmann through Kant, Schiller, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Herbart, Schopenhauer, and others) to show their incompatibility and obscurity. The start thus sets up a rigorous inquiry by demonstrating that current definitions of art and beauty are confused, unstable, and ethically unmoored. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76973": "\"Blackwood''s Edinburgh Magazine, Vol. 74, No. 454, August, 1853\" by Various is a literary periodical written in the mid-19th century. It presents a curated mix of essays, travel writing, literary criticism, current-affairs commentary, and serialized fiction, marrying scientific curiosity with social observation and narrative flair. Readers encounter pieces that move from the chemistry and culture of everyday stimulants to political portraits and adventurous journeys.  The opening of the issue lists its contents and begins with \u201cThe Narcotics We Indulge In,\u201d a sweeping essay that explains how different cultures meet the human craving for solace and stimulation, then closely examines tobacco (its global spread, manners of use, physiological effects, and active principles) and hops (their English cultivation, role in beer, soothing properties, and adulteration in low-grade brews). It notes the social and economic costs tied to these plants, from soil exhaustion to the entanglement of tobacco with slavery, and briefly reflects on how habitual narcotics may shape national character. A subsequent article, \u201cSouth American Travel and Adventure,\u201d opens with Dr. Weddell\u2019s ascent into the Bolivian Andes\u2014soroche at the high passes, vicu\u00f1a hunting, glimpses of La Paz society (including the attempted assassination of President Belzu), and an ultimately fruitless gold probe at the marsh of La Lancha\u2014before moving to the Yungas for scenes of mission life, fish-stunning poisons, and the harsh lot of bark-gatherers. Interleaved are Theodore Pavie\u2019s vivid sketches from the Pampas, including a lively post-house tableau that seeds tension between a muleteer and a convoy chief over the innkeeper\u2019s daughter.

The opening of the work first sets out the political backdrop: Fiji\u2019s cession to Britain, speeches by chiefs Thakombau and Maafu, Sir Hercules Robinson\u2019s role, the appointment of Sir Arthur Gordon, early administrative reforms, and economic prospects amid the devastation of a measles epidemic. The narrative then shifts to the author\u2019s journey\u2014assembling the Governor\u2019s party, sailing out, and pausing in Sydney for social calls and excursions to the Blue Mountains and the bush\u2014punctuated by the shocking account of Commodore Goodenough\u2019s death in the Santa Cruz Islands. She finally reaches Levuka with Royal Engineers and missionaries, finds Government preparations incomplete, and sketches the hardships of provisioning and household management.

{"76976": "The art of courtship by Clement Wood is a practical guidebook on love and relationships written in the early 20th century. It outlines how and why people woo, frames courtship as both instinct and social practice, and argues that mating should be chosen wisely for lasting happiness. The likely topic is advice on selecting a partner, wooing well, and conducting an engagement with maturity and tact.  The book moves from first principles to practice. It traces wooing\u2019s biological roots, weighs reasons for and against marriage, and urges both sexes to treat courtship as education in the opposite sex. It advises how to choose a mate\u2014balancing physical attraction, health, age, temperament, intellect, money, and social background\u2014while warning against \u201creform\u201d marriages and purely financial matches. It gives concrete guidance for men on making themselves genuinely attractive, communicating, proposing naturally, and continuing courtship after marriage; and for women, it dismisses gimmicky flirtation \u201ccodes,\u201d explains how to judge men, encourages tactful initiative (even proposing), and favors being a frank, fully human partner over being merely \u201cnice.\u201d Engagement etiquette covers rings, public behavior, jealousy, and the fraught question of premarital intimacy, with the engagement treated as a test that may wisely end in marriage\u2014or be broken. The closing section samples famous literary courtships and love poetry to inspire better wooing, while underscoring that the art of courtship is ongoing, mutual, and aimed at shared happiness.

{"76978": "The North-Americans of yesterday :  a comparative study of North-American\u2026. by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh is a comparative ethnological study written in the late 19th century. It surveys the lifeways, arts, languages, governments, myths, and material culture of Indigenous peoples across North America, arguing for their ethnic unity while correcting romanticism and crude \u201cstone-age\u201d time scales. Drawing on fieldwork, museum collections, and the Bureau of American Ethnology, it offers a broad, illustrated synthesis for general readers and students of American archaeology and ethnology.  The opening of this study explains its origin in public lectures, acknowledges major scholarly sources, and sets the author\u2019s aim: to present Indigenous North Americans as a coherent, once-vigorous world-race whose cultures varied by environment and history rather than by kind. Dellenbaugh critiques rigid global \u201cPaleolithic/Neolithic\u201d schemes, proposes that pre- or early-glacial land connections and climate shifts drove latitudinal migrations, and sketches a cultural gradient from southern centers (e.g., Yucatec) through Uto-Aztecan, Siouan, Algonquian, Athapascan, to the distinct Eskimo. He contrasts lowland declines with highland florescence (e.g., Nahuatl), notes mountain barriers shaping east\u2013west differences, and argues the glacial era\u2019s effects persisted into recent times. The introductory chapter also repudiates the misnomer \u201cIndian,\u201d adopts \u201cAmerind,\u201d and frankly recounts European brutality while urging objective study beyond stereotype. The next chapter begins a linguistic overview: many stock families and dialects, the persistence of languages (e.g., Tewa at Hano), sign-language and trade jargons like Chinook, the polysynthetic structure (with a Basque analogy), phonetic peculiarities, efforts to standardize transcription, and the notable homogeneity of Eskimo speech.

{"76979": "\"Blackwood''s Edinburgh Magazine, Vol. 74, No. 455, September, 1853\" by Various is a literary and political periodical written in the mid-19th century. This issue blends historical and economic analysis, cultural criticism, and serialized fiction, with pieces ranging from Scottish constitutional and fiscal grievances to foreign views of England, alongside Shakespearean notes, a continuing domestic novel, poetry, and religious reflection.  The opening of the issue presents a long essay, \u201cScotland Since the Union,\u201d which praises historian John Hill Burton\u2019s fairness yet faults his handling of Highland character, then argues that Scotland entered the Union as an equal but was later injured by English commercial restrictions, centralizing administration, and neglect. It recounts the path from the Revolution and Darien scheme through the Act of Security to the 1707 treaty, then details post-Union mismanagement\u2014customs and excise enforcement by outsiders, diversion of Crown revenues (with Holyrood left to decay), underfunded universities and public institutions, and inequities in policing and infrastructure\u2014before urging remedies: a Scottish Secretary of State, stronger representation, and faithful observance of the treaty\u2019s spirit. The issue then turns to \u201cForeign Estimates of England,\u201d reviewing Max Schlesinger\u2019s lively portraits of London and Parliament staged as dialogues between a steadfast English host, a grumbling Austrian exile, and a Paris-fixated Frenchman; it highlights English ceremonial continuity, contrasts it with continental revolutions, and sketches figures like Lord Palmerston with wry approval before the extract breaks off mid-anecdote.

{"76980": "\"Blackwood''s Edinburgh Magazine, Vol. 79, No. 485, March, 1856\" by Various is a literary periodical written in the mid-19th century. It gathers wide-ranging essays that review new books, probe classical and modern history, discuss church and state questions, and comment on current affairs. The tone blends scholarship with opinion, moving from rigorous criticism to vivid biographical and social sketches.  The opening of the issue devotes a substantial essay to Dr. Liddell\u2019s History of Rome, contrasting the blood-soaked boasts of ancient conquerors with Rome\u2019s distinctive role in shaping European civilisation. It surveys the shift in Roman studies from heroic narratives to critical debates over myth, tradition, and constitutional reconstruction, weighing Niebuhr\u2019s bold hypotheses against Sir George Cornewall Lewis\u2019s scepticism, and illustrating the value and limits of legend through stories like Coriolanus, Decius, and the Gallic sack. The reviewer praises Liddell\u2019s book as a useful, clear compendium for general readers, then sketches Rome\u2019s republican machinery\u2014short annual magistracies, citizen legions, and above all the Senate\u2019s enduring power\u2014before charting emerging moral decay, the harsh provincial tax-farming of the Publicani, Cato the Censor\u2019s stern crusades, and the corrosive effects of slavery. A second piece turns to Amans Alexis Monteil, recounting his obscure provincial roots, his family\u2019s ordeals in the Revolution, the saintly influence of his mother, the checkered fates of his brothers, and his own dogged archival hunts that fed a pioneering social history of ordinary French lives.

It appears to be a romantic-sensation tale that blends crime, blackmail, and social intrigue, following the beautiful but neglected Ismay Trelane and her scheming mother, Helen, as they collide with the le Marchant household and the charismatic Miles Cylmer. A suspicious death, missing diamonds, and a dangerous blackmailer set the tone, while Sir Gaspard le Marchant and his daughter Cristiane provide a refuge that may become a trap.  The opening of the story introduces Ismay, sent home from school to a mother intent on trapping Lord Abbotsford into marriage, and shows Ismay\u2019s impulsive night at a music hall where a handsome stranger protects and feeds her. Soon after, Helen sneaks into Abbotsford\u2019s house with a latch-key at his summons, finds him dead in a rose-colored room, panics, and\u2014at Ismay\u2019s urging\u2014returns only to remove her photograph as Mr. Cylmer briefly enters and later discovers the body. An inquest rules murder by person unknown; the diamonds vanish; and the unscrupulous Marcus Wray, who saw Helen\u2019s comings and goings, extorts the jewels and threatens exposure to gain power over Ismay. Cornered, Helen appeals to her cousin, Sir Gaspard le Marchant\u2014recently told he is dying\u2014who brings Helen and Ismay to his estate as companions for his daughter Cristiane; there, Cylmer (Ismay\u2019s unnamed rescuer) proposes to Cristiane and is rejected, meets Helen with a troubling sense of recognition, and the stage is set for intersecting desires, secrets, and danger.

The opening of the book frames the project with a preface noting these pieces first appeared in newspapers, a dedication, a Shah Latif epigraph, and a foreword praising Sind\u2019s landscape, romance, and new archaeological discoveries, before moving into the Sind tales. Kincaid retells the miracles and cult of Lal Shahbaz of Sehwan; the river-born savior Udero Lal who protects Hindus and leaves a shared temple-mosque; Zinda Pir (Al-Khidr/Elijah) as guardian of Indus boatmen; the life of Shah Abdul Latif and the making of Shah jo Risalo; and Makhdum Nuh\u2019s wonders, including realigning Tatta\u2019s great mosque. He then gives origin legends: Hyderabad (Nerankot) through Shah Makai and Haidar Ali; and two contrasting accounts of Brahmanabad\u2019s destruction, both blaming a wicked ruler. The section closes with a fairy-tale, The Eighth Key, where a loyal minister repeatedly saves his king at great cost and is restored, and it begins The Noose of Murad, explaining a ruined fort and a proverb through the rise of a bald grass-cutter favoured by fate.

{"76983": "\"Skeeter Bill comes to town by W. C. Tuttle\" is a Western novelet written in the mid-20th century. The story centers on a lanky, straight-shooting cowhand who returns to a dusty cattle town and stirs up trouble for the real culprits behind a notorious bank robbery. It blends range feuds, saloon politics, and a clever unraveling of a frame-up.  Skeeter Bill Sarg rides back to Yellow Butte to honor the twelfth birthday of his namesake, the son of his jailed friend Hooty Edwards\u2014convicted for a bank job Skeeter doubts he committed.

At the packed inquest, Skeeter springs a trap with bold bluff and sharper shooting, exposing a ring led by cattleman Sam Keenan, aided by saloon front man Slim Lacey and deadly foreman Johnny Greer. Lacey confesses to drugging Hooty\u2019s drinks to set him up while Keenan looted the bank and tried to pressure Margie.

Warm, humorous, and sprinkled with verse, it lingers on everyday wonders, friendship, and the comforts (and challenges) of domestic cat life.  The opening of the story introduces the kittens\u2019 plight and their rescue: after wandering hungry, they are spotted by a neighbor, brought to the gray house on the hill, and gently taken in by Elvira, Miss Harvey, and the initially reluctant Miss Winifred. Settling into their new home, they cause mishaps (a toppled candlestick, an alarming clock chime), receive treasured catnip mice, and witness a first snowstorm from cozy windows.

The volume gathers stories bound by themes of childhood and early emotional awakenings within adult social worlds. In the first novella, an almost eleven-year-old boy visiting a lavish country estate near Moscow is drawn into the games, rivalries, and hidden tensions of the grown-ups, especially a mischievous blonde beauty, the reserved and sorrowful Mme M., and her vain, controlling husband.  The opening of the collection follows the boy\u2019s arrival amid endless parties and entertainments, where he is teased publicly by the flirtatious blonde and quietly captivated by the gentle, melancholy Mme M. He witnesses her unease around her husband and senses a secret sorrow, while a passing cavalcade hints at unspoken ties.

It explains how to equip, handle, fire, and maintain spar-torpedoes from ships and boats, with emphasis on electrical firing gear, gun-cotton safety, and standardized Navy fittings.  The opening of the manual defines the Class D spar-torpedo outfit and distinguishes service, exercise, and contact torpedoes, describing their cases, stuffing-boxes, circuit-closers, spars, fittings, and cabling.

{"76988": "\"Aeolus; or, the future of the flying machine\" by Major Oliver Stewart is an aeronautical essay written in the early 20th century. It forecasts how aircraft will evolve and be used, arguing that society\u2019s attitude and policy toward aviation will shape progress more than pure technology. Stewart champions moving\u2011wing craft (notably the autogiro) for short urban hops and poor visibility, foresees giant flying boats as true long\u2011range air liners, and criticizes official and financial constraints while doubting the long\u2011term viability of rigid airships.  The opening of this work casts the aeroplane as an \u201caerial sailing\u2011ship,\u201d clarifies basic terms (wing, airscrew, propeller), and sets a pragmatic forecasting stance. Stewart then argues that Britain\u2019s aviation stagnation springs from overregulation and financier\u2011led standardization, prescribing \u201cfreedom of the air\u201d and craftsmanship to unlock progress. He contrasts a noisy, awkward passenger plane with the effortless gull to introduce the key idea of moving\u2011wing flight, presenting the autogiro as the first practical realization and predicting spot landings, rooftop terminals, and fog\u2011defying city\u2011center services. He anticipates a counter from fixed\u2011wing operators\u2014very fast, highly loaded machines aided by catapults, arresters, and high\u2011speed ground links\u2014and begins to sketch the longer\u2011range future in which immense hydro\u2011aeroplanes become the true air liners.

{"76989": "\"Aspects of science\" by J. W. N. Sullivan is a collection of essays on science written in the early 20th century. Framed from a humanistic and aesthetic point of view, it explores how scientific ideas emerge, evolve, and influence culture while clarifying methods, theories, and assumptions for the general reader. Expect reflective critiques of how science is pursued, taught, and popularized, alongside portraits of scientific minds and the philosophical implications of modern physics.  The opening of this collection sets out the premise that scientific ideas have histories and serve human needs, arguing that theories confer order, practical power, and aesthetic satisfaction even while remaining provisional. It explains scientific method as a selective, law-building enterprise whose \u201ctruth\u201d rests on shared judgment but whose \u201cmeaning\u201d is personal and artistic, citing the physicist\u2019s perspective (via Norman Campbell) and the growing gap between specialists and the public as language grows technical. Through cultural reflections and a striking portrait of Maxwell, the essays show science as intuitive and imaginative\u2014sometimes mystical\u2014yet disciplined. A sequence on assumptions dismantles inherited certainties (circular planetary orbits, na\u00efve probability, Euclidean space and time, the elastic \u00e6ther, and anthropomorphic readings of animals), showing how reasonableness shifts with evidence. Pieces on learning and popularizing science urge historical teaching and reading original memoirs, and critique both suave synthesizers of science with philosophy and religion and marvel-mongering \u201cpopular\u201d accounts. Overall, the start maps science\u2019s aims, methods, and misreadings while inviting non-specialists into its human context. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"76990": "\"Last letters from the living dead man\" by David Patterson Hatch is a collection of spiritualist letters and metaphysical essays written in the early 20th century. Framed as messages dictated through Elsa Barker\u2019s automatic writing, it offers posthumous guidance on America\u2019s moral destiny during and after the Great War, blending occult insight with practical civic counsel. The focus is on courage, unity, ethical reform, and the shaping influence of unseen worlds on national life.  The opening of this work begins with Barker\u2019s candid introduction: she recounts how the letters were \u201cwritten down\u201d during 1917\u20131918, her earlier volumes, her reluctance to continue automatic writing, and her turn to analytical psychology (especially Jung) while affirming a deep, experiential belief in immortality and the practical value of prayer and mysticism. The first letters from \u201cX\u201d invoke the \u201cGenius of America,\u201d urging fearlessness, service, and national unity amid wartime upheaval, and foretelling great change akin to winter giving way to spring. He warns that America suffers from an \u201cindigestion of gold,\u201d presses for rebuilding Europe, shipbuilding, fair lending, government stewardship of key utilities and food, and steady work to prevent panic and hysteria, while cautioning about a coming surge in psychic sensitivity and the need for restraint. Further letters advise honest dealing at home, level heads in turbulent politics, simple methods to calm fear, and describe \u201cinvisible armies\u201d aiding from beyond; they also stress America\u2019s role in spiritual culture, discuss reincarnated Native souls within the population, and narrate a forest encounter with an indigenous chieftain that reframes vengeance into future brotherhood\u2014before returning to the central theme that a nation\u2019s ideals, like individuals\u2019, determine its fate.

{"76991": "\"Episodes before thirty\" by Algernon Blackwood is a memoir written in the early 20th century. It traces the author\u2019s formative years through hardship, wanderlust, and spiritual seeking, from failed ventures in Canada and moral conflict over running a Toronto saloon to poverty and fear in New York, set against an evangelical upbringing and a growing devotion to Nature and Eastern thought.  The opening of the memoir recalls a stifling New York boarding-house where the young narrator endures vermin, hunger, and the menace of a petty forger roommate, cooks dried apples over gas jets, and sometimes sleeps on benches in Central Park. He then backtracks to his Canadian years: modest work at a Methodist magazine under kindly Dr. Withrow (who recoils when he admits he is a Buddhist), an ill-starred partnership in a Jersey dairy that collapses, and a second gamble\u2014buying the disreputable Hub Hotel with his friend John Kay\u2014despite a conscience formed by teetotal, evangelical parents. A flashy opening day at the saloon yields to decline, pilfering staff, and financial loss, even as he learns barroom tactics from Billy Bingham and wrestles with shame. Threaded through are vivid memories of evangelical childhood, Moravian schooling, early encounters with Patanjali, theosophy, and hypnotism, the guidance of a Hindu student, and, above all, nights alone in woods and by the lake whose rapture and calm teach detachment and help him endure.

Neighbor Eenokki, a dithering suitor, arrives first; soon come the brisk Ville Virkki and a jovial matchmaker, with Ville quickly flirting with Aili instead of Ruura. A comic motif \u2014 a washtub Josua built too large to fit through the door \u2014 lets the matchmaker \u201cforetell\u201d that its maker will never need to leave the house.

{"77002": "\"Tiervater Brehm :  Seine Forschungsreisen : Ein Gedenkblatt zum 100. Geburtstag.\" by Dr. Kurt Floericke is a biographical account written in the early 20th century. It commemorates the life and journeys of the naturalist Alfred Edmund Brehm, highlighting his African and European expeditions, his vivid field observations, and his role in popularizing zoology through works like the Illustrated Animal Life. The focus is on travel, adventure, and scientific discovery, woven with character sketches and cultural encounters.  The opening of this volume first sketches Brehm\u2019s background: his upbringing under the famed ornithologist Christian Ludwig Brehm, early talent, decisive Sudan expedition with Baron von M\u00fcller, later studies, travels, and authorship. A vivid scene in the Renthendorf parsonage shows M\u00fcller recruiting the young Brehm amid a technical debate on wagtail subspecies, leading to his departure for Africa. The narrative then follows Nile voyages with scrapes and misunderstandings, a near-fatal crocodile episode, and the dramatic, first-ever European passage of the Wadi Halfa cataracts. Hardships in Kordofan\u2014malaria, thirst, hostile misreadings, and the searing Samum\u2014contrast with rich natural-history observing, oases life, and a homesick Christmas night punctuated by wild elephants\u2019 trumpeting. Brief solo forays bring illness and tension with M\u00fcller over collecting results.

{"77003": "\"With the Indians in France\" by Sir James Willcocks is a firsthand military memoir written in the early 20th century. It presents the Indian Army Corps\u2019 experience on the Western Front, stressing their loyalty, endurance, and the realities of fighting in France and Belgium alongside British and French troops. From a commander\u2019s viewpoint, it addresses battlefield performance, cultural and logistical challenges, and the interplay between Indian units and their British officers. It will appeal to readers of World War I history and those curious about imperial forces in modern warfare.  The opening of the book moves from a ballad of a Sikh veteran, Hurnam Singh, celebrating Indian courage from Messines to Neuve Chapelle, into an introduction that defines the scope: not a grand history of the front, but an insider\u2019s account of the Indian Corps. Willcocks explains his sources and aims, defends his men against ill\u2011informed criticism, and bluntly diagnoses systemic weaknesses\u2014shortages of equipment, a flawed reserve system, too few British officers, and parsimony in India\u2014while praising the quality of British gunners, Indian sappers, and the devotion of Indian ranks. He sketches influential figures (Roberts, Kitchener, Minto, Hardinge, Roos\u2011Keppel) and recounts assembling the Lahore and Meerut Divisions, the welcome in Marseilles, the logistical scramble at Orl\u00e9ans, and the swift move to Flanders. He highlights smooth cooperation with the French and then describes the Corps\u2019 baptism of fire near Ypres, where battalions were split up and thrown in piecemeal. Early actions by the Connaught Rangers, the 57th (Wilde\u2019s) Rifles, and the 129th Baluchis show confusion, heavy losses of British officers, and striking acts of bravery, culminating in the machine\u2011gun stand that led to Sepoy Khudadad Khan\u2019s Victoria Cross.

The narrative surveys the planetary family: Mercury through Mars, the asteroid belt, then Jupiter (with four large moons and rapid spin), Saturn (with rings and many moons), Uranus, and Neptune, supported by memorable size-and-distance analogies. A vivid \u201cvisit\u201d to the moon portrays airless skies, extreme heat and cold, stark light and shadow, cratered landscapes, and Earth shining motionless in the lunar sky, before turning to comets\u2014their once-feared appearances, ethereal nature, varied orbits, behavior near the sun, and famous examples like Halley and Encke\u2014where the excerpt breaks off.

Set in a futuristic third millennium, it dramatizes a clash between a world-dominating trust magnate, Huggs, and his idealistic son Robert, with workers, politicians, and adventurers drawn into a struggle over monopoly, justice, and human dignity. Key figures include the ruthless heir Ernst, the fragile Gertrud, the lively Graciosa, and the engineer Straum. The play explores how private power, statecraft, and family loyalties collide when an empire seeks to control the globe.  The opening of the play presents Huggs in his fortress-like office, worshipping a private shrine as he rules markets and governments, while his wife Bertha pleads for their troubled son Ernst and news arrives that Robert is returning with a captured Union (Uniooni) air fleet. Huggs flaunts his dominance over ministers and a president seeking rescue, mocks a would-be royal claimant, and prepares to hand his system to Robert. When Robert arrives with Graciosa, he confronts Huggs over brutal labor policies and vows either reconciliation with the Union or open struggle; Huggs counters with a cold plan to starve Europe to win, demanding Robert\u2019s submission before a sacred portrait, which Ernst desecrates, shattering the moment. The second act shifts to a Union shipyard where Ernst\u2019s \u201cCatiline\u2019s boys\u201d plot sabotage, Gertrud warns Straum of danger, and Robert urges workers to reject Huggs\u2019s rich bribes and choose a peaceful, coordinated strike to stop his final monopoly; the workers agree just as Huggs appears to accuse Robert and Straum of deceiving them, claiming Europe\u2019s fate is already sealed.

It depicts a gentle, instructive day in a small classroom, weaving simple academics with moral guidance and Christian devotion. The likely topic is a rainy-day school session in which a kind teacher blends grammar, arithmetic, stories, and Scripture to nurture obedience, gratitude, and kindness.  On a wet morning, Mary Carrow welcomes her pupils\u2014Charles, Harry and Lucy Linn, Lily and Eddy Forester, Susan Field, Ellen Raby, and the tardy Carry Deacon, who has been delayed by stopping to admire kittens and arrives soaked. Mary comforts and equips Carry with dry shoes, then teaches nouns, leads blackboard shapes and multiplication in concert, and oversees indoor games at recess. Carry privately confesses her missteps; Mary counsels her about thoughtfulness, gives a short prayer for forgiveness, and encourages better habits. The class shares a simple communal dinner (with much delight over small pies) and observes a quiet moment of gratitude. In the afternoon they recite definitions, answer basic questions about the senses, practice writing, and hear a true story about a kind muffin-man who aids a poor sailor\u2019s family.

{"77011": "\"The organisation of thought, educational and scientific\" by Alfred North Whitehead is a collection of essays on education and the philosophy of science written in the early 20th century. It advocates a living, integrated approach to learning that unites theory with practice, rejects \u201cinert ideas,\u201d and reshapes curricula\u2014especially mathematics and technical training\u2014to cultivate judgment, creativity, and style. The volume likely moves from classroom reform and the social purpose of technical education to broader reflections on scientific concepts and how thought is organized.  The opening of this volume sets its scope in a preface\u2014first essays on education, then pieces on the philosophy of science\u2014before launching, amid wartime urgency, a plea for reform. Chapter I lays down two rules (teach few subjects, teach them thoroughly), attacks inert information, argues that proof and use must go together, criticizes uniform external examinations, and defines education as cultivating culture, expertise, and \u201cstyle,\u201d closing with duty and reverence as its moral core. Chapter II reframes technical education as inherently liberal, insisting that joy in work, moral vision, and art power skilled labor, invention, and enterprise, and that manual craft, science, and literature must interpenetrate. It sketches three intertwined curricula (literary, scientific, technical), stresses hand\u2013eye practice, proposes broad, non-narrow training linked to appropriate sciences, and treats literature as enjoyment rather than grammar. Chapter III, a prize-day address, praises perseverance in wartime, calls students to public service, and urges the Polytechnic to be a civic center where art, recreation, and craft elevate work\u2014linking Southwark\u2019s theatrical heritage to modern industry and casting the institute as an \u201carsenal for peace.\u201d The start of Chapter IV argues that mathematics in general education should shed recondite detail for a small set of powerful ideas\u2014number, quantity, and space\u2014illustrated through experiments, graphs, simple calculus, statistics, and the history of ideas (for example, Euclid\u2019s Book V).

{"77012": "Die Wei\u00dfe Rose by B. Traven is a novel written in the early 20th century. Set in the Mexican oil zone, it contrasts an aggressively expansionist U.S. oil company with an Indigenous hacendado, Hacinto Yanyez, whose ancestral, communal understanding of land refuses commodification. As the company targets the hacienda La Rosa Blanca, the narrative focuses on the clash between corporate power, legal maneuvers, and the dignity and cohesion of a rural community.  The opening of the novel establishes the Condor Oil Company\u2019s voracious land-grab tactics and then centers on La Rosa Blanca, an eight-hundred-hectare hacienda owned by Hacinto Yanyez. Agents arrive to lease or buy, brandishing promises and piles of gold, but Hacinto rejects them on principle, seeing the land as a trust for his descendants and his compadres rather than a saleable asset.

{"77013": "\"Historical sketches of the south\" by Emma Langdon Roche is a historical account written in the early 20th century. It traces the origins, laws, and persistence of American slavery, then narrows to a vivid, documentarian chronicle of the last known slave ship, the Clotilde, and the Africans (the Tarkars) brought to Alabama. Blending broad history with eyewitness testimony and the author\u2019s own illustrations, it focuses especially on Mobile, the illegal trade\u2019s networks, and the formation of a distinct African community.  The opening of the work surveys how contrasting colonial cultures in Virginia and New England shaped attitudes toward slavery, outlines the rise of the tobacco economy and the 1619 arrival of enslaved Africans, and follows early Southern-led efforts (notably Jefferson\u2019s) to restrict the trade amid Northern commercial complicity. It then details how illegal trafficking flourished despite the 1808 ban, covering diplomatic clashes with Britain, the Ashburton Treaty patrols, and notorious cases like the Wanderer and Echo. The narrative shifts to Mobile in 1858\u20131859\u2014amid filibuster tensions and local defiance\u2014where river-man Tim Meaher and Captain William Foster send the schooner Clotilde to Dahomey; it recounts the Dahomean raid on the Tarkars, their laws and customs, their sale at Whydah, and the harsh but comparatively less brutal \u201cmiddle passage\u201d under Foster. Finally, it describes the clandestine night tow up Mobile Bay, the burning and scuttling of the Clotilde, and the secret removal of 116 captives to a canebrake plantation, where they were hidden in whispered silence\u2014marking only the beginning of their story.

{"77014": "\"Select works of Porphyry :  Containing his four books on abstinence from animal\u2026.\" by Porphyry is a collection of philosophical treatises written in the 3rd century. It gathers his ethical case for abstaining from animal food, an allegorical interpretation of Homer\u2019s Cave of the Nymphs, and brief auxiliaries for understanding intelligible realities, here presented in English with scholarly framing. The focus is Neoplatonic ethics and metaphysics aimed at a contemplative, purified life, with a translator\u2019s appendix elaborating the Odyssey\u2019s allegory.  The opening of the volume presents a translator\u2019s introduction that sketches Porphyry\u2019s life, his role in transmitting and clarifying Platonism, and outlines the contents and aims of the included works. Then Book I of On Abstinence begins as a letter rebuking a friend (Firmus) for returning to meat-eating; Porphyry announces that he will answer the strongest objections\u2014from Stoics, Peripatetics, Epicureans, and a polemicist named Clodius\u2014and he summarizes their claims about justice, utility, law, sacrifice, medicine, population, and transmigration. He then marks off his true audience\u2014those seeking a contemplative life\u2014and argues that happiness is living according to intellect, which requires withdrawing from the senses and passions (especially those inflamed by diet), cultivating solitude and moderation, and choosing light, simple foods so the soul loosens its bond to the body and turns upward to intelligible being.

The work follows a Finnish traveler\u2019s journey through Estonia and Livonia, from Helsinki to Tallinn and Tartu, mixing on-the-spot observations with history and social commentary. It highlights medieval towns, churches, transport and prices, and everyday customs, while documenting the Estonian national awakening around choral festivities and the memory of emancipation from serfdom.

The narrator sails to Tallinn and vividly describes the harbor approach, the city\u2019s walls, churches, Toompea, and historical anecdotes, noting sharp social divisions and practicalities of travel. With no railway, he proceeds by post road toward Tartu, sketching the flat-to-undulating landscape, peasant houses, beggars and geese, and the drivers\u2019 stops at roadside inns. On the way he repeatedly meets choirs bound for the festival and is moved when they greet the Finns by singing national songs. Arriving in Tartu, he sketches the town, its university setting, and the Vanemuine society\u2019s organization of a large song festival led by J. W. Jannsen, with rehearsals, a church service, and concerts.

{"77018": "\"Madri.... per ridere : romanzo\" by Cesare Tronconi is a novel written in the late 19th century. It appears to be a caustic social satire about hypocrisy, respectability, and the making of \u201cmothers\u201d and women shaped by appearances rather than virtue. The story centers on Maddalena, a striking and increasingly calculating young woman from a modest family, whose transformation is catalyzed by a seductive neighbor, Severina, and a secret attraction to Severina\u2019s brother. Expect a sharp critique of bourgeois morals, the education of girls, and the gap between public piety and private appetites.  The opening of the work moves from a sardonic funeral scene\u2014where mourners shun two ominous women\u2014to a vehement letter that brands Maddalena \u201cthe Evil,\u201d then rewinds to her origins. We meet her parents, the punctilious ex-dogana clerk Ildebrando and the devout, simple Caterina; her birth is framed by superstitious omens, and her childhood is marked by precocious will, emotional opacity, and social ostracism at a snobbish school. As an adolescent she grows restless and is drawn to Severina, a poised \u201cwidow\u201d whose perfumed, sensuous apartment and conversation school Maddalena in toilette, allure, and worldly cynicism. Under this influence, she refashions herself, spurns a safe suitor, and quietly cultivates a flirtation with Severina\u2019s brother, while the narration sketches the type of idle, debt-driven beaux who live off charm\u2014hinting at the kind of man she may be courting.

{"77019": "\"A preface to morals\" by Walter Lippmann is a work of social and moral philosophy written in the early 20th century. It examines the modern loss of religious certainty and authority, the emptiness that can follow emancipation from orthodoxy, and the need to find a credible, disciplined humanism to guide conduct in a secular world. Lippmann probes why both triumphant disbelief and nostalgic return fail to satisfy, and why moral life requires more than taste, mood, or fashion.  The opening of the book traces the \u201cproblem of unbelief\u201d: those no longer anchored by ancestral faith feel aimless despite newfound freedoms, and the liberal prophecy of deliverance has disappointed, leaving people nervously credulous and tempted by new cults. Lippmann contrasts modernist redefinitions of God (abstract, symbolic, or metaphysical) that lack compelling authority with fundamentalist demands for literal historical facts; he shows how the former cannot sustain popular devotion, while the latter, lacking a sure arbiter, collapses into schism\u2014Catholic critique included. He argues that higher criticism and \u201cdecoding\u201d Scripture (e.g., turning immortality into a platonic ideal) strip religion of the certainty and external sanction that once consoled, commanded, and unified ordinary believers. Finally, he sketches the \u201cacids of modernity\u201d: shifting political analogies for God, urbanization, mobility, media-driven novelty, and the loss of familiar landmarks all corrode piety; fundamentalist agitation appears as anxious compensation for a confidence that has already ebbed.

It explains the practical cultivation and processing of vanilla, emphasizing climate, soil, planting systems, hand pollination, curing, and marketing, with guidance shaped by experience in the Seychelles.  The bulletin opens with a warning by D. G. Fairchild about a devastating fungous disease and the need to exclude it from new growing regions, then presents Galbraith\u2019s field-tested methods. He describes the Seychelles\u2019 humid, warm conditions and suitable soils; advocates wider spacing and training vines on individual support trees to reduce disease; and explains how to start a vanillery using long cuttings, mulching, shading, and careful tying and lowering of vines. He details preparing vines for flowering by timely checking of growth to align with a short dry spell, then outlines precise hand pollination, prudent fruit set per vine, and harvest cues to avoid splitting. The curing method features brief hot-water scalds, sweating in blankets, and slow drying through a heated, then warm, then cool room, followed by sorting by length and quality, neat bundling, and tin packing.

{"77027": "\"A brief summary in plain language of the most important laws concerning women\u2026\" by Barbara Leigh Smith is a legal pamphlet and reformist tract written in the Victorian era. It explains the civil and property status of women in Britain, especially under marriage, and argues for legal reform to secure women\u2019s separate rights. The likely topic of the book is the effect of English law on women\u2019s property, marriage, divorce, custody, and civic standing.  The work first outlines the position of unmarried women, who can own property and pay taxes but lack political franchise, and explains inheritance rules that favor male heirs in real property. It then details marriage law, including prohibited degrees, civil and ecclesiastical forms, and Scottish irregular marriages, before setting out coverture: a wife\u2019s legal identity merges with her husband\u2019s, who controls her person, earnings, and personal property; her contracts and lawsuits must run through him; and he holds strong rights over her real estate during cohabitation. Equity offers limited relief through settlements for a wife\u2019s separate use, but custody of children rests with the father, and divorce is costly and largely a privilege of the rich; only separation is commonly obtainable, while full dissolution requires parliamentary action. The pamphlet summarizes widows\u2019 rights (paraphernalia, dower or jointure, a share in personalty if intestate), women\u2019s capacities as agents, trustees, or executors (often constrained by marriage), and the harsh treatment of illegitimate children and their mothers under maintenance and inheritance rules. In its concluding remarks, it criticizes over-legislation and the injustice of husbands\u2019 control of wives\u2019 earnings\u2014especially harmful to working-class families\u2014surveys fairer practices abroad, and presents a reform program: allowing married women to hold separate property, make contracts and wills, adjust spousal liabilities, and establish equal succession rights, urging public petition to secure these changes.

{"77028": "\"Uncle Tweazy and his quizzical neighbours, vol. 2 :  a comi-satiric novel\" is a comic-satiric novel written in the early 19th century. Set in a country parish, it skewers provincial pretension and gossip through the sharp-eyed Uncle Tweazy and his nephew, Victor St. Alban. Its central thread is Victor\u2019s instant infatuation with the angelic Rosa Fitzclarence of the Rectory, counterpointed by his uncle\u2019s aching memory of a lost first love, while a bustling gallery of neighbours provides farce and social satire.  The opening of the novel follows Uncle Tweazy and Victor to the Rectory, where Rosa\u2019s beauty, harp-playing, and voice transfix them\u2014so much so that Uncle Tweazy later reveals his sorrowful past with Cecilia Delmond, whose fate echoes in Rosa\u2019s features. Dr. Tonic barges in with village gossip, and a run of episodes ensues: a flashy masked-party invite from Mrs. Fungus, a coarse encounter with the miller\u2019s wife and the filthy baker Sponge, and a gracious tour of Lady Lustre\u2019s grounds. A boisterous dinner at Mrs. Henpeck\u2019s parades caricatures\u2014Munchausen\u2019s absurd boasts, the henpecked host, and petty spats\u2014before Sunday service showcases Rosa\u2019s devout singing and magnetism for the whole congregation. Back at the Rectory, talk of sermons and scandal gives way to a gentle botanical walk where Victor and Rosa quietly bond.

{"77029": "Le droit \u00e0 la paresse :  r\u00e9futation du droit au travail de 1848 by Paul Lafargue is a political-economic essay and socialist polemic written in the late 19th century. It challenges the capitalist cult of work and the liberal \u201cright to work,\u201d instead advocating the right to leisure as a foundation for human flourishing.  The book denounces the moral, religious, and economic glorification of labor, arguing that overwork degrades bodies and minds, exploits women and children, and fuels overproduction, crises, and poverty. Drawing on historical contrasts with ancient disdain for servile toil, factory reports of brutal hours, and the absurdities of bourgeois consumption and colonial expansion, it claims machines should liberate people rather than enslave them. It calls to ration labor across the year, reduce daily work to three hours, expand rest and festivals, and raise workers\u2019 consumption so production serves life.

A revelatory moment comes when he sees the seasoned shepherd Nils Vatne driving a flock at sunset; the boy secretly walks at night to a distant fold to ask about becoming a shepherd and is gently encouraged to grow. Later, a bell he treasures betrays his hideaway to the bullies, who destroy his little world and injure his back; bedridden and weakened, Kristofer endures his father\u2019s impatience while clinging to the faint, consoling chime of the bell and to visions of the path that leads into the mountains.

{"77032": "\"The Garden Yard: A Handbook of Intensive Farming\" by Bolton Hall is a practical agricultural handbook written in the early 20th century. It explains how ordinary people can turn small plots, backyards, or suburban lots into productive, profitable garden farms through intensive cultivation. The focus is on practical methods\u2014soil preparation, crop planning, seed selection, pest control, marketing, and co-operative selling\u2014aimed at making a good living near towns and cities.  The opening of this handbook sets a clear, down-to-earth tone: the preface promises plain advice for busy, non-scientific readers and urges learning by doing. An introduction by N. O. Nelson champions farm life, proposes colony purchases of land, and strongly advocates co-operation for buying, marketing, and credit. Early chapters then outline the core method: grow garden crops near markets; think first about market access; favor ownership over renting; keep buildings simple; and use brains more than brawn. The text explains soil and subsoil, moisture and mulch, humus and tilth; stresses fertility through green manures and legumes; advises on choosing a location with access to manure, water, and buyers; and covers seed quality, simple germination tests, and practical plant-breeding by selection. It summarizes plant needs (water, air, light, warmth, lime), the value of crop rotation, and the control of weeds, insects, and diseases, before showing how to restore soil with humus, even touching on lawn care. At the start of the working plan, it recommends a modest plot, fall plowing, testing for soil acidity, applying manure wisely, and planting in long rows for easy wheel-hoe cultivation.

{"77034": "\"The works of the Reverend George Whitefield, M.A., Vol. 5 (of 6) : Containing\u2026.\" by George Whitefield is a collection of sermons written in the late 18th century. The volume gathers evangelical expositions on Scripture that press themes of human sin, Christ\u2019s redeeming work, conversion, holy living, and practical devotion. Expect vigorous, plainspoken appeals, doctrinal clarity about grace versus works, and pastoral guidance for daily piety.  The opening of the volume presents transcriber\u2019s notes, a title page outlining sermons, tracts, and letters, a detailed contents list, and then launches into the sermons. Sermon I expounds Genesis 3:15, retelling the Fall, exposing Satan\u2019s subtlety, contrasting human fig\u2011leaf righteousness with God\u2019s grace, identifying the \u201cseed of the woman\u201d as Christ, and arguing that salvation rests on the covenant of grace rather than human conditions; it urges believers to expect persecution yet promises Christ\u2019s ultimate victory. Sermon II, on \u201cWalking with God\u201d (Genesis 5:24), defines such walking as reconciliation through Christ, habitual communion, and steady growth, and prescribes means\u2014Scripture, secret prayer, meditation, reading providence, heeding the Spirit by the Word, ordinances, and fellowship\u2014before motivating hearers by the honour, joy, and heavenly end of such a life, with pointed calls to sinners, saints, and ministers. Sermon III begins the testing of Abraham (Genesis 22), distinguishing God\u2019s trials from temptations to evil and highlighting Abraham\u2019s ready obedience, but the excerpt breaks off as that exposition gets underway.

{"77035": "\"Liberty and the news by Walter Lippmann\" is a collection of political essays written in the early 20th century. It is a non-fiction tract that examines how freedom, public opinion, and journalism intersect, with a concise focus on the crisis of news reliability and its consequences for democratic self-government.  The book argues that democracy cannot function without a steady flow of truthful, relevant, and intelligible news. It critiques the press for subordinating truth to patriotic edification, shows how classical defenses of free speech (from Milton and Mill to Russell) collapse when facts are missing, and explains how complexity, distance, and propaganda create a pseudo-environment that misleads the public and empowers demagogues. The author shifts the liberty debate from policing opinions to protecting the sources, organization, and comprehension of information. He proposes practical reforms: transparent sourcing and documentation, stronger accountability for falsehoods, professional training for reporters in evidence and language, and independent institutes to record and analyze government and public affairs. He urges universities to support this work and calls for an endowed, editorially neutral news service to compete with biased structures. The core message is that genuine liberty is secured by institutions that make facts accessible and trustworthy, so public opinion can be both free and responsible.

{"77036": "\u201cA millionaire at sixteen : or, The cruise of the Guardian-Mother\u201d by Oliver Optic is a juvenile adventure novel written in the late 19th century. It follows Louis Belgrave, a level\u2011headed sixteen-year-old who has unexpectedly become a millionaire, as he embarks on sea-going adventures shaped by duty to his mother, guidance from a prudent trustee, and the lure of world travel. Expect nautical action, moral tests, and a globe\u2011trotting premise centered on yachting, with figures like the genial Uncle Moses, the seasoned Captain Ringgold, and a menacing former stepfather complicating the voyage.  The opening of the story sets up Louis\u2019s fortune, character, and intentions: after good\u2011natured sparring with his trustee about wealth and prudence, he plans to buy a modest schooner for quiet cruising with his mother. A suave stranger, \u201cMr. Frinks Fobbington,\u201d offers a too\u2011good\u2011to\u2011be\u2011true yacht inspection at Southfield; Louis goes with his mother, Captain Ringgold, and his friend Felix.

The book follows the working-class agitator Pelle as he leaves prison and tries to reclaim a place in Copenhagen\u2019s labor movement while rebuilding his broken family life. Set in a vividly drawn urban Denmark, it blends social struggle with intimate questions of guilt, love, and renewal. Readers can expect a sober, human portrait of a man caught between public cause and private duty.  The opening of the story sets a stark contrast between a forbidding prison and the bright spring fields, then follows Pelle\u2019s first steps into freedom. He encounters the embittered Ferdinand, refuses to be drawn back into crime after a scuffle, and walks toward the city reflecting on the hard lessons of solitude\u2014his guilt toward Ellen and the children, the shock of learning about a new child, and a determined hope to begin again. Reaching N\u00f8rrebro on election day, he cannot find his family at the old address, briefly and painfully recognizes his son, is ignored or misremembered at a tavern, and rescues the drunken Glade Jakob, whose fate exposes how easily the fallen are cast aside.

{"77038": "\"Trading in Scrabbletown\" by Alice Brayton is a historical account written in the mid-20th century. Drawing on a cache of early 19th-century shop papers, it reconstructs the trading world of Scrabbletown (Swansea, Massachusetts) through the life and work of trader Israel Brayton. The focus is on how his company store linked local farms, weavers, and small factories to regional markets, with recurring figures like his wife Keziah, partners John Mason and William Bowers, and clerk Wheaton Luther.  The opening of the book explains the discovery of a barrel of never-published papers and uses them to identify Brayton and his network, then sketches his family background, brief wartime service, and marriage before following his return in 1815 to open a company store tied to the Swansea Union Cotton Manufacturing Company. It shows how he organized home weavers, paid largely in goods, and stocked an astonishing range of supplies sourced from Boston, Providence, and beyond, while juggling credit, counterfeit notes, and shortages. The narrative then follows his expansion to an Egypt (Somerset) branch, additional yarn from the Lyman and Georgia mills, and dealings with the Fall River (Troy) factory, alongside glimpses of community life\u2014poor relief, school governance, church singing, and period reading tastes. A sizable section traces a straw-bonnet venture: placing braid with local young women, pressing and boxing bonnets, and testing markets via trips to Newport, Albany, and New York. It closes with William Bowers in Savannah trying to sell bonnets and textiles on commission, reporting frank market feedback on fashion, sizing, and quality.

Set in a mythic Finland, it follows the Pirkkala ruler Teivas, his Halikko-born consort Pyynikki, Teivas\u2019s son Lemma, and the Lapp leaders Kyr\u00f6 and Inku as trade, tribute, and power collide. The drama centers on political intrigue, ethnic tensions, vengeance, and a dangerous attraction that threatens the fragile balance of power.  The opening of the play unfolds in Teivas\u2019s hall, where the Lapp woman Inku laments her daughter\u2019s ruin and conspires with the Lapp chief Kyr\u00f6: they speak of smuggling, burning the Pohjankangas as cover, and Halikko\u2019s brewing revolt against Pirkkala. Pyynikki enters withdrawn, bonds warily with Inku, and brightens when Lemma arrives; their mutual passion flares and they plan to flee after news that Pyynikki\u2019s father Hahma has died, but Teivas\u2019s sudden return halts them. Teivas interrogates Kyr\u00f6 and reveals Hahma was killed by a Nokian-marked arrow from Kyr\u00f6\u2019s quiver, ordering him imprisoned, while Pyynikki coolly asks leave to attend the funeral with Lemma as escort; Teivas resists, intent on asserting marital rights first. At the start of the next scenes, Inku helps Kyr\u00f6 slip out through a secret passage, Pyynikki wavers between escape and resolve, and Teivas and Lemma face a tightening siege: Halikko men across the water, Ulve\u2019s dominance at Kokem\u00e4ki, and Lapp tribes on the move, leaving Pirkkala in mounting peril.

{"77040": "\"Le Selve\" by Ouida is a novel written in the late 19th century. Set in the vast Italian woodlands of Lazio, it follows Cyrille, a Russian exile turned estate steward, whose humane, orderly reforms clash with the ingrained brutality, poverty, and customs of the local squatters. At its heart stands Muriella, a strong, devout peasant who alone understands him, creating a stark, tense portrait of conscience, class, and survival amid a merciless rural world.  The opening of the novel shows an old peasant dying neglected by his family, as Cyrille arrives too late, rebukes their callousness, and meets Muriella in the night, who warns him he is in danger. The narrative then paints the history and grandeur of Le Selve and reveals Cyrille\u2019s past as a Tolstoyan noble and political exile seeking purpose in stewardship, while the locals resent his curbs on theft, poaching, and abuse of \u201ccustomary rights.\u201d We see Caterina, the shrewd housekeeper; the grim burial at San Vitale that Muriella quietly oversees to prevent a fraud; and a kitchen scene where the under-steward Fausto and two friars rail at the \u201cnortherner\u201d until Muriella defends his justice. At the start of this story, Muriella rejects Fausto\u2019s advances, makes a pilgrimage to Viterbo to pray for Cyrille\u2019s return home, endures her uncles\u2019 suspicion, and continues to warn Cyrille that the men of the woods may kill him, while he contemplates helping her escape a hard life he cannot easily change.

{"77041": "\"The works of the Reverend George Whitefield, M.A., Vol. 6 (of 6) :  Containing\u2026.\" by George Whitefield is a collection of sermons written in the late 18th century. This volume gathers evangelical preaching on repentance, faith, grace, and the work of the Holy Spirit, pressing hearers to turn from sin and embrace Christ. Its themes emphasize heartfelt conversion over outward religiosity, urgent calls to accept the gospel now, and warnings against self-righteousness. Readers can expect fervent appeals, vivid biblical exposition, and practical exhortation aimed at personal renewal.  The opening of the volume presents transcriber\u2019s notes, a title page, and an extensive contents list of sermons keyed to scripture, then launches into preaching. Sermon XXXII (\u201cA Penitent Heart\u201d) defines true repentance as a God-wrought inner change\u2014sorrow for sin, hatred of it, and forsaking it\u2014explains its causes in divine grace, argues its necessity for salvation, and urges immediate turning to Christ with strong warnings and tender encouragements to great sinners and counsel to grateful believers. Sermon XXXIII (\u201cThe Gospel Supper\u201d) expounds Luke\u2019s parable of the great banquet, rebukes worldly excuses, traces its fulfillment from Jews to Gentiles, defends field-preaching, and warmly invites the poor and outcast to come to Christ while warning of the peril of refusal. Sermon XXXIV (\u201cThe Pharisee and Publican\u201d) begins by exposing natural self-righteousness, contrasts Pharisee and Publican in the temple, critiques boastful prayer and judging others, and cautions against trusting in religious acts like fasting and tithing as grounds of justification.

{"77042": "\"Der Untergang des Abendlandes, Erster Band\" by Oswald Spengler is a treatise on the philosophy of history written in the early 20th century. It contends that high cultures are living organisms with birth, growth, and decline, and advances a comparative \u201cmorphology\u201d to forecast the West\u2019s transition from culture to civilization. The work rejects linear, Eurocentric periodizations and reads arts, sciences, politics, and religion as symbols that express each culture\u2019s inner form and destiny.  The opening of the book frames the project amid a crisis-ridden age and declares its aim: to determine whether history has a logic that allows one to foresee the remaining stages of Western culture. It contrasts mathematical law for dead forms with analogy for living forms, calling for a rigorous technique of historical comparison rather than casual parallels. The author distinguishes nature (causality, the logic of space, mathematical number) from history (fate, the logic of time, chronological number), and asks \u201cfor whom\u201d history truly exists. He argues that Greeks and Indians were fundamentally ahistorical, whereas Egyptians were intensely historical, illustrating this through time-symbols like cremation versus mummification, calendars, and the invention of clocks. The book opposes the simplistic scheme of Antiquity\u2013Middle Ages\u2013Modernity and the provincial centrality of Western Europe, proposing instead multiple equal, landscape-bound high cultures that live and die by their own inner laws. It traces the tripartite scheme to late antique Gnostic-Christian thought, criticizes teleological philosophies, and urges a historically relative perspective that sees each culture\u2019s arts, sciences, and morals as unique expressions of its fate.

{"77043": "\"Der Untergang des Abendlandes, Zweiter Band\" by Oswald Spengler is a philosophical-historical treatise written in the early 20th century. It presents a sweeping \u201cmorphology of world history,\u201d portraying high cultures as living organisms with fated life-cycles and situating the modern West in its phase of decline. This volume ranges across cities and peoples, religion, the state, politics, money, and technology to frame a grand comparative theory of cultural rise and decay.  The opening of the work contrasts the plant\u2019s cosmic, bound, rhythmic life (Takt) with the animal\u2019s free, polar, tension-filled microcosm (Spannung), then builds to the human world of the eye and light, where word-language emancipates understanding from sensation and gives rise to thinking. Spengler sets Dasein (destiny, time, blood) against Wachsein (spatial consciousness, causality), opposes facts to truths and practice to theory, and links human religiosity to the fear of the invisible and the recognition of death. He distinguishes \u201cdestiny men\u201d (statesmen, warriors, entrepreneurs) from \u201ccausality men\u201d (priests, scholars) and explores mass souls that surge beyond mere opinion into shared fate. Turning to \u201cthe group of high cultures,\u201d he separates the world as history from the world as nature, shows how horizons widen from child and primitive life to cultural panoramas, contrasts Greek narrowness and Magian sacred chronologies with the faustian, planetary, and open-ended historical vista, and layers history from astronomy and geology through biology to human cultures and biography. The section closes by challenging 19th\u2011century mechanistic, surface-level explanations (Lyell, Darwin), urging a physiognomic, form-oriented reading of nature and history that seeks living patterns rather than causal systems.

{"77044": "\"Una misura eccezionale dei Romani, Il senatus-consultum ultimum (studio di storia e di diritto pubblico romano)\" by Corrado Barbagallo is a historical-legal study written in the early 20th century. It investigates the senatus consultum ultimum as Rome\u2019s emergency safeguard, cataloging its cases, reconstructing the legal framework that enabled it, and explaining its political function amid struggles between populares and optimates. The work analyzes procedures, formulas, and effects (including hostis publicus, tumultus, iustitium, intercessio, and provocatio) and argues how and why this extraordinary measure arose, endured, and ended with the imperial order.  The opening of the study sets out three aims\u2014narrate every instance of the decree, rebuild the constitutional conditions that allowed it, and interpret its nature\u2014while declaring a clear methodological stance that favors sociological (materialist) explanation over mere annalistic narrative. It then defines the senatus consultum ultimum as an exceptional delegation of power to consuls and others and re-examines the earliest purported cases (one amid a war with the Aequi, the other in the agitation around M. Manlius Capitolinus), embedding them in the harsh debt regime and plebeian distress, and weighing doubts about their historicity. Next, it sketches the later, better-attested uses tied to social and political crises: the Gracchan reforms and their repression, the violence around Saturninus and Glaucia, the Catilinarian emergency, and subsequent episodes through the late Republic (including measures against tribunes, urban tumult after Clodius\u2019s death, and clashes around Caesar, Pompey, Antony, and Octavian). The excerpt closes by beginning a systematic treatment of the decree\u2019s name, occasions, exclusion of intercessio, executional force, and flexible procedures regarding time, place, and formula.

{"77045": "\"Agricultural zoology\" by J. Ritzema Bos is a scientific handbook written in the late 19th century. It surveys the animal kingdom with an emphasis on species that harm or help farming, offering clear identification, biology, and practical notes for students and working farmers.  The opening of the book sets its purpose and audience in the author\u2019s and translator\u2019s prefaces, with Eleanor A. Ormerod\u2019s introduction underscoring its practical value; a detailed contents list signals broad coverage from vertebrates to protozoa. It then explains zoological classification and binomial naming, followed by a concise primer on vertebrate anatomy and physiology (skeleton, muscles, nerves, digestion, circulation and respiration, reproduction including alternation of generations), and how heart structure differs across vertebrate classes. The text proceeds into applied accounts of mammals relevant to agriculture: cats, dogs, foxes, and mustelids (marten, polecat/ferret, stoat, weasel, mink, otter, badger) with balanced notes on damage versus benefits; insect-eaters (shrews, the mole, hedgehog) largely presented as allies; bats as valuable nocturnal insect hunters; and rodents (hares and rabbits, then mice and rats) with concise identification and their typical harms. This opening portion concludes mid-discussion of mouse and rat species and their agricultural impact. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"77046": "\"Gleanings in Europe :  Italy, vol. 2 of 2\" by James Fenimore Cooper is a travelogue written in the early 19th century. It presents an American traveler\u2019s observations as he moves through southern Italy and into Rome, blending vivid landscape writing with sketches of antiquities, local life, and pointed political asides. The focus is on coastal routes, ruined temples, museums, and city approaches, all filtered through a reflective, often comparative American eye.  The opening of the work follows the narrator from Sorrento down the precipitous Scaricat\u00f2jo to Amalfi by boat, then along the Gulf of Salerno to Eboli and the malarial plain en route to Paestum, whose massive Temple of Neptune sparks meditations on time and endurance. He contrasts desolate, fever-haunted lowlands, buffalo teams, and a tale of roadside murder with the grandeur of the ruins, then returns via Salerno, a mountain road to Pompeii, and Castel-a-Mare, where Murat\u2019s wartime seizures prompt a sharp critique of American commercial politics. Back in Naples after a rough passage, he revels in street theaters on the mole, the softness of autumn skies, and the museum\u2019s treasures, watching Herculaneum papyri painstakingly unrolled and musing on artifacts, taste, and even U.S. coin design. The route to Rome brings the great aqueduct and palace of Caserta, Capua, an accidental walk on a surviving stretch of the Appian Way, Gaeta and Terracina, and the Pontine Marshes (with a comic false alarm over supposed banditti). A first long view of the Roman Campagna leads to an awe-struck entrance past the Colosseum and Forum and a powerful first encounter with the immensity of St. Peter\u2019s. The section closes with an outline of the Campagna and ancient walls, questioning the usual site of the Tarpeian Rock and weighing Rome\u2019s wall circuits and population.

{"77047": "\"Wings of silver by Evelyn Gage Browne\" is a collection of inspirational poems written in the early 20th century. The book centers on spiritual awakening and resilience, using images of wings, stars, sky, and the sea to explore love, faith, and the soul\u2019s ascent beyond fear and sorrow.  The poems move from an opening hymn to the life-force that urges all creation to unfold, to meditations on purposeful journeying, the omnipresence of divine Love, and the patient power of faith. A cosmic chorus calls humanity to claim its divine likeness, while a life-spanning monologue transforms loss and death into homecoming. We encounter moral parables of weaving despair through hate or contentment through love, a vow to keep the heart\u2019s door open despite risk, and a confession that fame and gold weave only a tattered web without Love as warp and woof. The speaker answers fear with song and lifts eyes above mire to the stars, reframing victory as the sweetness kept in the soul, not the struggle itself. The collection culminates in an extended prayer to the sky for cleansing, freedom, and uplift, asking to be remade in Love and set joyfully soaring. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"77048": "\"Twenty years in Roumania\" by Maude Rea Parkinson is a memoir of travel and social observation written in the early 20th century. Drawing on decades spent teaching and moving in Romanian society, it offers an intimate, often humorous portrait of the country\u2019s people, institutions, and landscape, from the capital\u2019s salons to village greens. Expect first-hand sketches of geography, politics, religion, and custom, framed by the author\u2019s affectionate yet candid outlook.  The opening of the memoir sets out the author\u2019s purpose and loyalties, then follows her youthful decision to settle in Bucarest, her arduous journey via Vienna and Hungary, and her bracing first impressions of the city. It quickly widens into a clear, informal guide to the country\u2014its mountains, rivers, railways, and the drama of the Danube\u2014before turning to parliament, raucous elections, and a stiff but brave army shaped by the monarchy. The religious life of the Greek Orthodox majority appears through priests\u2019 rounds, Easter rites, and the legend of Curtea d\u2019Argesh. Bucarest is sketched as a garden-like capital of trams, the Calea Victoriei, splendid churches, and domestic habits like serving \u201cdulceata,\u201d followed by a stark account of land tenure, peasant hardship, and a violent rural rising that drew troops to the countryside and anxiety to the capital, where she notably kept her nerve by going to church. The section then lingers on village life\u2014music, the hora and s\u00e2rba, embroidered dress, rustic weddings, and evening songs\u2014while noting how townsfolk sometimes exploit peasant naivety. It closes by segueing into a discussion of trade and commerce. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}
{"77049": "The adventures of Twinkly Eyes the little Black Bear by Allen Chaffee is a children\u2019s nature adventure written in the early 20th century. The story follows a lively black bear cub named Twinkly Eyes (and his brother Woof) as he learns survival skills in the woods through playful mishaps and close calls. Episodic encounters with porcupines, snakes, storms, bees, rabbits, a lynx, and even a curious farm boy mix humor with gentle peril, while slipping in simple natural-history lessons. It\u2019s a warm, instructive woodland romp designed to nurture empathy for wildlife.  The opening of the story shows Twinkly shoved into a lake by his brother, rescued by their watchful mother, and hastily taught to swim\u2014and to climb\u2014when a black snake slithers near and a prickly porcupine family commandeers their pond and tree. A thunderstorm brings practical guidance about sheltering among safer trees, while Mother Bear warns that lightning and men with guns are the true dangers. As seasons turn, Twinkly grows bolder: he\u2019s misled by a jay toward squirrel nests, then braves a bee tree for honey, gets badly stung, falls, and cools the swelling with clay before dozing off satisfied. He spies the secretive Cottontail clan (and later their moonlit \u201cbunny ball\u201d), tries to ambush a rabbit but falls asleep, and narrowly evades a fox alert. A meeting with a farm boy ends with Twinkly stealing a trout and outwitting an attempted treetop capture, while Mother Bear coolly teaches new cubs to fish. Further episodes include mistaking a wasp nest for a bee trove despite a porcupine\u2019s warning and a young lynx learning the hard way why porcupine quills demand respect.

{"77050": "\"Does civilization need religion? :  A study in the social resources and\u2026.\" by Reinhold Niebuhr is a treatise on religion and society written in the early 20th century. It examines whether and how religion can sustain personality, supply moral energy, and guide social life in a mechanized, secular age shaped by science and industrialism. The work argues that religion\u2019s metaphysical plausibility and its social efficacy are both under pressure, yet it may still offer indispensable resources for ethical reconstruction.  The opening of the treatise diagnoses religion\u2019s waning influence in modern urban-industrial life, noting that science challenges a personalized universe while impersonal economic systems corrode respect for persons. It contrasts frantic orthodoxy and accommodating liberalism, arguing that the urgent crisis is not intellectual alone but moral: religion\u2019s failure to make civilization ethical alienates especially the working classes. The author then sketches religion\u2019s positive resources\u2014reverence for personality, the courage to love and forgive beyond what reason alone sustains, humility before absolute standards, and a motive stronger than determinist cynicism\u2014for building a just society. He critiques middle-class and urban forms of faith for private rectitude without social imagination, and traces how historic compromises made religion conservative (e.g., Protestantism\u2019s ties to nationalism and commerce) while Catholicism at times exerted stricter social ethics. Finally, he contrasts medieval monastic rigor, Catholic economic restraints, and papal universalism with Protestant secularization and Puritan discipline, showing how virtues of industry and thrift slid into sanctified wealth and power, narrowing love of neighbor and oversimplifying ethics at the very point where modern society most needs depth.

His circle widens to include the widow Marfa, her children Tim and Aksa, and a fallen lamb he rescues, as he seeks harmony between people and the wild.  The opening of this novel frames the tale as one told to the narrator by Yakut Tim about his Lamut stepfather Turgen, a solitary healer shunned after a shaman\u2019s \u201cvisions\u201d and village gossip claim he consorts with rams and devils. Turgen befriends the poor widow Marfa and her children, trades food for milk, and turns his loneliness into a mission: hauling hay to the crags to feed a small herd until they accept his presence; he even scares off a bear and watches their leader repel wolves. He dreams of the Great Spirit\u2019s approval, then, when gunshots panic the herd and a lamb falls from a rock bridge, he doctors the lamb\u2014Lad\u2014at home, despite fresh rumors stirred by a drunkard who sees it.

It centers on the power of outdoor advertising\u2014especially posters and painted signs\u2014to reach all kinds of people and stimulate rapid retail growth.  The narrative follows a worried department-store general manager who studies his failing numbers, then seeks advice from a circus executive famed for getting \u201cthe greatest amount of money in the shortest possible time.\u201d He learns that the circus wins by blanketing the outdoors with large, colorful, simple messages placed wherever people pass.

{"77053": "En marge des mar\u00e9es by Joseph Conrad is a collection of short stories written in the early 20th century. The volume gathers sea-shadowed tales of moral ambiguity and psychological tension; its opening story follows Geoffrey Renouard, a solitary planter on the island of Malata, drawn into the refined yet urgent quest of Professor Moorsom and his daughter Felicia for a vanished man. Expect atmosphere, restrained passion, and a steady pull between romance and stark reality.  The opening of the collection presents a translator\u2019s note on the French title and an author\u2019s note in which Conrad defends these \u201ctales\u201d as a romance of reality, explaining his methods and responding to critics of The Planter of Malata. The narrative then begins in a colonial city: Renouard, back from Malata, tells a journalist about a dinner at the Dunsters where he met the distinguished Professor Moorsom, his white\u2011haired sister, and the striking Felicia, who questions him about wanderers and colonial lives; he is quietly overwhelmed by her presence. The editor supplies the backstory: Felicia seeks her former fianc\u00e9, Arthur, who fled after a financial scandal, later proved innocent; the family has arrived incognito to find him, relying on the press, police notices, and a letter waiting poste restante that remains unclaimed. As Renouard visits the Dunsters, he falls into a contained, jealous longing, dreams obsessively of Felicia, and maintains a controlled, respectful silence; he aids their councils even as the professor weighs ending the wait to resume commitments, leaving the search\u2014and Renouard\u2019s inward crisis\u2014poised to intensify.

The contents open with a vivid tour of backstage mechanics\u2014from multi-level trapwork and lightning scene-changes to ingenious illusions in Parisian spectacles, sea-and-fire effects, and the craft behind them. A serialized melodrama reaches its climax with a fatal riverside struggle, a widow\u2019s heartbreak, and a quiet country wedding, before closing on reconciliations and new vows. A long feature on diamond-smuggling traces ruses from Poe-like \u201chiding in plain sight\u201d to hollow teeth, baby rattles, rosary beads, and carrier pigeons, then turns to theft and reset at Kimberley and the saga of the Orloff diamond. \u201cDoubleworks,\u201d an Athlone barracks tale, recounts a night alarm when a half-witted hanger-on, locked in the dead-house, terrifies a sentry and loses his reason. Industry pieces highlight the Baku oil \u201cspouters,\u201d bulk transport and fuel uses, and their challenge to American oil and Scottish shale; and review Scotland\u2019s past and present experiments in tobacco-growing. \u201cThe Month\u201d gathers notes on Japanese sulphur baths, house-fire risks from bad flues, Pasteur\u2019s hydrophobia results, petroleum engines, waste dye liquors turned to ink, a hardy golden carp, safer electric lamps, a global photographic star map, technical training, small-arms trials, dynamite cruisers, microphones for water leaks, new steam-valves, and a Scottish petroleum spring. Occasional notes touch infant feeding with finely milled farinaceous additions to milk, wood-pulp building ornaments, and long-distance electric power; a closing lyric, \u201cSweet Day of Days,\u201d offers a gentle reverie.

{"77055": "\"The wilderness by Amy E. Mack\" is a lyrical nature essay written in the early 20th century. Set in a suburban Australian patch of reclaimed garden now overrun by native bush, it celebrates urban wildness\u2014its plants, birds, insects, and nocturnal animals\u2014and argues for the quiet riches of leaving small sanctuaries where nature can thrive.  The narrator lovingly traces the seasons in this bush-girt haven: fruit trees mingling with wattles, mistletoe, native cherry, and a beloved white cedar that invites birds to feast and sing. By day the place hums with life\u2014cicadas, butterflies, dragonflies, ants, spiders\u2014and a dazzling array of birds, from bright parrots and honeyeaters to butcher-birds, thrushes, cuckoos, and the gentle mistletoe-bird. At night bandicoots rustle, ring-tailed and big possums travel the treetops, and owls and mopokes hunt in silence, while after rain the creek swells and a comic, exuberant chorus of frogs begins. The piece closes as a quiet plea for keeping such patches wild, showing how even a small refuge in a suburb can shelter a rich, intimate world of living things.

{"77056": "\"The dream detective\" by Sax Rohmer is a collection of detective stories written in the early 20th century. It follows the eccentric, occult-leaning sleuth Moris Klaw and his sharp-witted daughter Isis as they unravel uncanny crimes often tied to museums, relics, and legends, accompanied by a skeptical inspector and a journalist-biographer. Expect locked-room puzzles, exotic lore, and audacious disguises.  The opening of this collection presents two complete cases and the start of a third. First, a night watchman dies in a locked gallery at the Menzies Museum; Klaw\u2019s \u201cdream\u201d method and keen observation reveal a booby\u2011trapped \u201cAthenean Harp\u201d that lethally pricks whoever lifts it after it has been played, and the culprit proves to be the curator\u2019s sleepwalking daughter unknowingly setting events in motion. Next, an Egyptian potsherd coveted by a suave new neighbor leads to eerie s\u00e9ances and a daring theft; the twist shows that \u201cDoctor Zeda\u201d and the phantom singer were Klaw in disguise and Isis, retrieving the artifact as a matter of poetic justice. The third tale opens with Klaw and allies called to Crespie Hall, where a new owner is found slain by a crusader\u2019s ax in the old banqueting hall, setting the stage for another impossible\u2011seeming mystery.

{"77057": "\"Hirviherrat :  Kolmin\u00e4yt\u00f6ksinen huvin\u00e4ytelm\u00e4\" by Kl. U. Suomela is a stage comedy written in the early 20th century. Set around a moose hunt in rural Finland, it satirizes city swagger and country shrewdness through flirtations, fibs, and mishaps as landowner Joonas Isomaa, his daughter Inkeri, crofter family Miina\u2013Vihto\u2013Urho, and the Helsinki beer-merchant Kalle Maljanen with his foppish son Santeri cross paths. The likely focus is a farcical rivalry for Inkeri\u2019s hand, a tangle of missing guns and tall tales, and a mock-heroic hunt that exposes pretensions and tests character.  The opening of the play finds morning bustle at the Junnila croft: Miina manages chores, Urho tends his rifle, and Vihto grumbles awake as townsmen arrive to hunt. Santeri hilariously mistakes the household rooster for a trophy bird and begs to hide the blunder before the party\u2014nimismies (sheriff), constable, and Isomaa\u2014file in for coffee, wartime news, and gossip. A letter brings Siina sudden hope of a rich American half-brother\u2019s return, only for the newspaper to hint he may have perished at sea; Kalle immediately begins courting the newly \u201cheiress\u201d widow, while Inkeri quietly disarms the Maljanens by hiding the father\u2019s gun and removing the bullet from Santeri\u2019s. At the start of Act II on Korpim\u00e4ki, Inkeri and Urho reveal their mutual affection and stage a test of Santeri\u2019s courage: she spooks him with a tale of a local brute, and Urho bursts in as the supposed menace, just as Santeri is trying to posture as her fearless protector.

{"77058": "\"The historians'' history of the world in twenty-five volumes, volume 11\u2026\" by Henry Smith Williams is a historical compendium written in the early 20th century. This volume surveys the history of France from the later Carolingians to the death of Louis XIV, blending political narrative with religious, social, and cultural developments as distilled from numerous classic authorities.  The opening of the volume recounts the collapse of Carolingian power under relentless Northmen raids and internal strife, portraying Charles the Bald\u2019s weakness, the ferocity and tactics of the Vikings, and the famed pirate Hastings. It explains how the Edict of Mersen and the capitulary of Quierzy hastened the transformation of benefices into hereditary fiefs, birthing the feudal order and proliferating private castles. The siege of Paris (885\u2013886) highlights civic resilience under Bishop Gozlin and Count Eudes against a vast Viking host, contrasted with imperial impotence, and foreshadows the rise of the Capetians. The narrative then traces Rollo\u2019s investiture in Normandy, the fragmentation of royal authority, and the power plays of Robert, Rudolf, H\u00e9ribert, and Hugh the Great, through Louis IV and Lothair, to the election of Hugh Capet and his early struggles with Charles of Lorraine\u2014depicting a France where noble power eclipses the crown and the church often arbiters the realm.

{"77059": "\"Illustrations of taxation\" by Harriet Martineau is a collection of didactic tales written in the early 19th century. It uses lively domestic and rural scenes to show how taxes, rents, and game laws press on everyday people, beginning with the return of the Cranston heirs to their long-shuttered estate and the frictions that follow between landowners, tradespeople, and poachers. Central figures include the Cranston siblings\u2014Richard, James, Wallace, and Fanny\u2014alongside the horse-dealer Swallow, his identical twin daughters Anne and Sarah, and the ever-calculating assessor, Mr. Taplin.  The opening of the first tale, The Park and the Paddock, follows the Cranstons as they break into their sealed house at Fellbrow, survey its desolation (owl, cobwebs, and a grim cat-and-rat relic), and set about repairs while hearing warnings of poaching. In town, Fanny\u2019s valet meets gossiping shopkeepers whose complaints about hair-powder, rents, and house-duty introduce the book\u2019s tax theme, while the assessor eyes the new family\u2019s dogs, carriages, and windows. At the Paddock, Swallow hurriedly loads a van with suspect \u201cpackages\u201d as the huntsman and then the assessor arrive, and his twin daughters\u2014Anne and the sharper Sarah\u2014come into view. James, a clergyman and sportsman, flirts with the twins between funerals and house-hunting, lunches with a farmer who explains the ruinous cost of game on crops and the quiet league with poachers, and debates the injustices of the land-tax. As James keeps visiting to find Fanny a horse, Sarah displaces Anne in his favor; learning of a planned night expedition, she tries to warn him off, while the Paddock readies drink, pipes, and sawdust for what looks like a poaching night and James urges his brother to act.

{"77060": "\"The autobiography of a seaman (volume 1 of 2)\" by Earl of Thomas Cochrane Dundonald is a naval autobiography written in the mid-19th century. It charts the celebrated but contentious career of a British admiral known for daring operations, outspoken reformism, and political battles, set chiefly against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars. This first volume focuses on his early life, family background, formative service, and the lead-up to the celebrated but disputed action at Aix Roads, alongside his criticisms of naval administration.  The opening of the work presents a dedication to the Westminster electors and a forthright preface outlining its scope: service up to the Basque Roads attack, the ensuing court-martial of Lord Gambier, years of exclusion from command, and eventual restorations of rank and honours. Cochrane thanks prominent supporters (notably the Marquis of Lansdowne and Lord Brougham) and credits his wife\u2019s direct appeal to the sovereign for a key turn in his fate, then states a \u201cmoral\u201d about the personal costs of truth-telling and reform. An introductory chapter traces the Dundonald lineage\u2014from medieval Cochranes and the rise and fall of Robert Cochran under James III, through staunch Stuart loyalties, civil-war entanglements, and the family\u2019s elevation\u2014before turning to the author\u2019s own beginnings. Chapter I sketches his 1775 birth, the loss of ancestral estates, and his father\u2019s scientific ventures (soda, alumina, British gum, sal ammoniac, white lead, and coal-tar/coke), including an early, accidental demonstration of coal-gas illumination later developed by others; these pursuits, though inventive, ruined the family finances and delayed his entry into the navy.

{"77061": "\"Nausica :  Tragedia en tres actes treta de l''Odissea d''Homer\" by Joan Maragall is a play written in the early 20th century. This lyrical tragedy revisits the Odyssey\u2019s Phaeacian episode, centering on the young princess Nausica and a shipwrecked hero whose arrival tests hospitality, piety, and desire. It follows Nausica, Ulisses, King Alcinous, the queen, and the court poet Daim\u00f3 in a poised blend of myth, music, and moral debate.  The opening of the play shows Nausica by the river with her companions, restless after a storm and stirred by a dream of marriage; she imagines a hero and then meets the naked, battered Ulisses, whom she aids and discreetly directs toward the city. At a palace feast, courtiers argue over libations, the queen announces the stranger, and the king extends sacred hospitality; Daim\u00f3\u2019s song of Troy moves the guest to tears. In private, he reveals himself as Ulisses and recounts trials like the Sirens and the descent to the underworld, while Nausica\u2019s admiration intensifies. At dawn in the port, fishermen and sailors ready a ship as Dimant explains the oracle and Poseidon\u2019s anger, and Nausica confides to Daim\u00f3 her trembling fascination before the departure is set in motion.

It is a botanical and therapeutic critique that challenges the identification of a modern plant from Cyrenaica as the famed silphion of antiquity, and questions the medical claims attached to it.  The work dismantles the claim that the so\u2011called Silphium cyrenaicum equals the ancient silphion, demonstrating instead\u2014through seed, leaf, root, and anatomical comparisons with herbarium specimens and literature (Viviani, de Candolle)\u2014that it is simply Thapsia garganica. Field evidence from M. Daveau\u2019s expedition to Cyrenaica confirms the match and refutes assertions about \u201ctracing\u201d roots and universal seed destruction. The book contrasts ancient descriptions (parsley\u2011like leaves, edible parts, culinary use) with the modern plant\u2019s vesicant, dangerous resin, and rejects coin imagery as unreliable for species diagnosis. It also scrutinizes promotional medical claims (phthisis, meningitis, etc.), reproducing a decisive letter from Dr Chartier denying therapeutic benefit and noting failures and risks. An appendix critiques contemporary brochures and clarifies sources, ending with the firm conclusion that the celebrated silphion remains lost while the marketed substance is merely Thapsia garganica.

{"77063": "\"William Shakspere and Robert Greene : the evidence\" by William Hall Chapman is a literary study written in the early 20th century. It reconsiders Elizabethan literary history and the Shakespeare canon by stripping away later traditions and conjectures, arguing from documents rather than \u201caesthetic\u201d myth-making. Central to its case is the claim that Robert Greene\u2019s famous \u201cupstart crow\u201d barb targeted the clown William Kemp, not Shakespeare, alongside a broader rehabilitation of Greene\u2019s character and work. The study also probes the Elizabethan stage economy and questions familiar assumptions about Shakespeare\u2019s life and authorship.  The opening of the book lays out this revisionist aim, then closely examines Greene\u2019s deathbed letter appended to \u201cGreene\u2019s Groatsworth of Wit,\u201d arguing that \u201cShake-scene\u201d meant a dance-scene and fits the celebrated clown-dancer William Kemp; it supports this with a compact (but vivid) dossier on Kemp\u2019s career, notoriety, and improvisatory \u201cjigs.\u201d It reads \u201cupstart crow\u201d and \u201cTyger\u2019s heart wrapt in a Player\u2019s hide\u201d within Elizabethan idiom, rejects Shakespearean authorship inferences from \u201cbombast out a blanke verse,\u201d and contends the line in Henry VI echoes Greene\u2019s own phrasing. The text defends Greene against charges of envy and dissoluteness, praises his clean prose romances and democratic sympathies, doubts the authenticity of several posthumous pamphlets, and recasts Henry Chettle\u2019s \u201cKind-Heart\u2019s Dream\u201d apology as aimed at Marlowe/Nashe/Peele rather than Shakespeare. It then begins a sober sketch of Shakespeare\u2019s early life based on records\u2014his father\u2019s rise and decline, uncertain schooling, and a pressured, irregular marriage\u2014underscoring how little firm evidence supports the standard biography.

The opening of Wood Cottage : or, Sheltered at last introduces Kit\u2014newly found by her parents during a Sunday-school outing\u2014and Ben, the poor but steadfast cousin who kept her alive by selling matches.

The opening of this novel introduces a series of vivid episodes: Molly and Humphrey\u2019s \u201ctorturing games\u201d spiral into a mock martyrdom that nearly ends in disaster; jealousy of a visiting cousin\u2019s curls leads Molly to cut them off in a Samson-and-Delilah prank; shy Violet, misreading a remark, bravely pays a formal call alone and causes social consternation; their mother must leave for her health, and Teddy tries to stow away before later being whipped for sweeping a chimney in play; Molly\u2019s zeal to \u201cmissionary\u201d her siblings culminates in an insulting bathroom placard that offends a visiting German musician until Humphrey mends matters; and, at last, the children\u2019s chaotic home theatricals are rescued by their mother\u2019s unexpected return, which steadies the household and brings the first performances off happily.

{"77066": "\"The evolution of the oil industry\" by Victor Ross is a historical account written in the early 20th century. It charts how petroleum progressed from ancient curiosity to a globally organized, technology-driven industry, highlighting the United States\u2019 pioneering role, standardization, and the systems that made oil vital in peace and war. Expect clear explanations of origins and geology, early Pennsylvania breakthroughs and figures like Edwin L. Drake, global fields, drilling and pipelines, refining, and the industry\u2019s economic and social reach.  The opening of this volume sets the tone with a preface arguing that petroleum enabled a new industrial \u201corder,\u201d reducing waste through standardized production and organization, with the U.S. leading and benefiting society broadly. It then surveys oil in history and legend\u2014from biblical and classical references to Baku fire temples, Asian practices, Native American use, and George Washington\u2019s remarks\u2014before explaining what petroleum is, competing origin theories, geological migration, natural gas, gushers, and the diversity of crudes. The narrative turns to America\u2019s beginnings: salt-brine drilling that revealed oil, Kier\u2019s \u201crock oil,\u201d Bissell\u2019s vision, and Drake\u2019s 1859 Titusville well, followed by booms like Pithole. A global overview follows (Russia, Roumania, Galicia, British imperial fields, Dutch East Indies, Japan, Mexico, Peru) and the rise of U.S. dominance across Pennsylvania, California, Oklahoma, and Texas. Practical chapters outline how geologists locate pools, how wells are drilled (cable-tool and rotary), \u201cshooted\u201d with nitroglycerin, and pumped, along with costs and risks.

The volume foregrounds beauty, downplays martyrdom and violence, and underscores the roles of prominent collectors and dealers\u2014especially Sir Joseph Duveen\u2014in shaping America as a new repository of masterpieces.  The opening of this volume presents a preface asserting the book\u2019s novelty and scope, crediting American collectors and Duveen\u2019s influence, listing celebrated works with illustrious provenances, arguing for the superior selectiveness of American collections, and declaring a \u201cBeauty\u201d-driven selection while noting extraordinary valuations. It then outlines the contents by national schools and begins with a clear, contextual primer on Sienese painting as a refined Gothic offshoot with Byzantine and possible Oriental affinities. Early entries describe Sassetta\u2019s St. Francis scenes, Matteo di Giovanni\u2019s brocaded Madonna, and Benvenuto di Giovanni\u2019s lively Adoration, each with vivid formal analysis and ownership history.

We meet Esben (\u201cNopsa\u201d), Karen, and Valdemar amid songs, playful camaraderie, and quiet resolve, which are jarred by the appearance of a German buyer, Ruprecht J\u00fcrgens, singing Lorelei and openly pursuing Karen. Community debate over a forced auction and the sale of Danish land to a German shows simmering anger and the call for mutual support, while domestic scenes at H\u00f8jemarke introduce the stalwart matriarch, the old servant Sidsel, and friend Gyrithe.

It documents a French mission in Central Saharan Africa that combined scientific surveying with military operations. The central question is whether Lake Chad ever connected to the Nile via the Bahr el Ghazal depression, set against detailed accounts of routes, oases, climate, terrain, and local peoples during Senoussist unrest and wartime pressures. Expect systematic observation, maps, and logistical realities rather than a narrative travelogue.  The opening of this work lays out the mission\u2019s aim, Tilho\u2019s background and route into the Lake Chad region, and the 1912\u20131913 campaign that seized key Senoussist strongholds at Ain Galakka, Faya, Gouro, and Ounianga. It explains why taking Borkou mattered strategically during the broader Turco\u2011German\u2013Senoussist push, then sketches four demanding years of holding the oasis network. Tilho offers vivid, practical portraits of Kanem, Borkou, and Ounianga\u2014their water, winds, heat, soils, crops (chiefly dates), pests, and trade in salt and dates\u2014before pushing east to the Tekro and Sarra wells on the Koufra route and recounting a perilous return guided only by compass. He advances through Dimi into the little\u2011known plateaux of Erdi, mapping water points and altitudes, and then crosses a broad depression to Ennedi, where measurements lead him to conclude the Chad basin is a closed system, not linked to the Nile. The narrative then surveys Ennedi\u2019s terraced sandstone plateaux, seasonal wadis, natural cisterns, rich pastures, sparse, raiding-prone tribes, and the spectacular valleys of Arche\u00ef, followed by reconnaissance west into Mortcha\u2019s wadis and the ancient lake zones. With the Great War\u2019s \u201choly war\u201d agitation inflaming raids, he describes French counter\u2011raids and then turns to Tibesti, outlining the plan, hazards, and a striking ascent of Emi Koussi\u2019s vast crater before returning to regroup for further operations.

Shaped as a continuation of Homer\u2019s world, it follows Telemachus, guided by Minerva in the guise of Mentor, on a moral and political education through perilous voyages that test his character. The narrative blends adventure with counsel on wise kingship, temperance, and justice, often contrasting tyranny with humane rule.  The opening of the work presents transcription notes, a translator\u2019s preface, and a substantial biographical essay that situates F\u00e9nelon\u2019s life, his clash with Bossuet, his role as tutor to a prince, and the political aims of the narrative. Book I then shifts into the story: Calypso, grieving for Ulysses, welcomes shipwrecked Telemachus and his guide Mentor; amid idyllic settings, songs, and banquet, she tries to keep the youth by offering happiness and hints of immortality, while Mentor warns against seductive ease. Pressed to speak, Telemachus recounts visits to Pylos and Sparta, a reckless voyage toward Sicily, a storm that throws him near Aeneas\u2019s fleet, near-sacrifice by Acestes\u2019s people, and Mentor\u2019s prophetic aid in repelling invading barbarians, after which they receive a ship. Book II relates their capture by an Egyptian squadron enforcing Sesostris\u2019s maritime power, a vivid tour of Egypt\u2019s prosperity under just governance, the separation of Mentor by a corrupt minister, and Telemachus\u2019s exile as a shepherd in the Oasis desert, where a divine voice steels him to endure and grow in wisdom\u2014the point at which the excerpt breaks off.

{"77074": "The Run by John Hay is a work of nature writing and natural history written in the mid-20th century. It explores the spring migration of alewives on Cape Cod, weaving close observation with ecology, local history, and culture. Guided by a reflective narrator and figures such as a blunt, protective herring warden, it portrays the fish\u2019s sea-to-pond journey, its perils, and its long ties to human communities.  The opening of this work follows the narrator\u2019s March vigil at Brewster\u2019s Herring Run on Stony Brook, moving from raw \u201cwaiting weather\u201d and a watchful muskrat to the first lone alewife and then the mass run. He introduces Harry Alexander, the warden, and shifts between scene and context: the anadromous life cycle, age and size patterns, and the fish\u2019s historical place from Indigenous agriculture and Pilgrim survival to smokehouses, weirs, and today\u2019s lobster-bait trade. Vivid set pieces show crowded ladders, fatal leaps at an impassable chute, and gulls thronging the valley, while chapters mix anatomy and senses with puzzling questions of homing, ocean whereabouts, and environmental cues. He traces the brackish plume at Paine\u2019s Creek, witnesses night entries under gull-filled skies, then a brutal daylight hunt where hundreds of gulls intercept fish on the ebb, and concludes with the fish\u2019s back-and-forth ascent at the estuary threshold as salt gives way to fresh.

{"77075": "\"Man''s supreme inheritance :  Conscious guidance and control in relation to\u2026\" by F. Matthias Alexander is a treatise on psychophysical education and health written in the early 20th century. It argues that modern civilization fosters maladaptive habits of use and that genuine well\u2011being depends on replacing subconscious reactions with conscious guidance and control of mind and body. The work critiques quick fixes\u2014physical culture drills, relaxation, deep breathing, hypnotism, and faith\u2011healing\u2014and proposes systematic re\u2011education to restore coordination and resilience. It extends these ideas to education, character, and social evolution.  The opening of this treatise sets its tone with a boatman\u2019s weather metaphor to reject panaceas and promise careful, experience\u2011based guidance. The author frames an urgent response to modern physical deterioration and the limits of bacteriology, appealing to all readers while insisting that real progress requires eliminating specialized \u201ccures\u201d through personal understanding and effort. An introductory word by John Dewey praises the central thesis: our crisis stems from uncoordinated living, and the remedy is intelligent, positive, conscious control\u2014not a return to nature or piecemeal fixes. The first chapters trace humanity\u2019s shift from instinctive to civilised living, argue that we cannot go back, and call for conscious control to replace faulty subconscious guidance; they then critique \u201cphysical culture,\u201d relaxation, and deep breathing (illustrated by a \u201cJohn Doe\u201d case and the harms of collapsed thoracic use), listing core problems like defective kinesthetic sense and inhibition. Subsequent sections redefine the subconscious (against \u201csubliminal self\u201d theories), emphasize inhibition, and reject hypnotism and faith\u2011healing as degrading or unreliable, advocating instead the quickening of the conscious mind; a stammer case shows how inhibition and new guiding orders can re\u2011educate use. The final portion provided begins to apply these principles broadly\u2014addressing temper, addiction, and even crime\u2014arguing for gradual, reasoned re\u2011education to change points of view and restore normal sensory guidance, before the excerpt breaks off mid\u2011argument.

{"77076": "\"Classics of Modern Science (Copernicus to Pasteur)\" by William S. Knickerbocker is a curated anthology of scientific writings written in the early 20th century. The volume gathers representative primary texts from foundational figures of modern science, framed for students and general readers to trace the rise of the scientific method and its civilizational impact. It emphasizes accessible language, the human qualities behind discovery, and the use of these classics to illuminate how scientific ideas were forged. The likely topic is the evolution of modern scientific thought from early method and astronomy through chemistry, biology, and medicine.  The opening of the anthology presents a preface arguing that the history of science is the real history of humankind, praising the scientific attitude (patience, humility, honesty), urging clear prose for lay readers, and positioning the book as a teaching reader. It then offers editorial headnotes and substantial excerpts: Francis Bacon\u2019s Novum Organum passages critique dogmatism and skepticism, advocate a disciplined inductive method guided by \u201cprerogative instances,\u201d and outline practical modes of acting on nature to restore human \u201cempire\u201d through experiment. Copernicus\u2019s introduction explains his dissatisfaction with Ptolemaic inconsistencies, defends heliocentrism, and argues for a spherical, moving earth (including daily rotation) to harmonize celestial phenomena. Kepler\u2019s Epitome defines astronomy, situates it among the sciences, contrasts common-sense appearances with Copernican insight, and marshals lines of argument for Earth\u2019s rotation. The Galileo dialogue then stages a debate on whether daily celestial motion belongs to the heavens or to Earth, favoring the Earth\u2019s rotation while previewing further Copernican reasoning.

The opening of this collection presents an editor\u2019s preface outlining Flynn\u2019s life and byline attribution, the scope and method of compilation (writings through the late 1920s), and a categorized table of contents. It then moves from brief humorous vignettes to substantive cultural essays arguing that writers shape public opinion and history, reading the Washington Monument as a symbol of American virtues, mapping a \u201creconstruction\u201d outlook for post-war literature, defending free verse, and showing how music mirrors an age; a practical piece on effective correspondence follows. A run of devotional and social-religious articles urges Sabbath reverence, interprets \u201clight\u201d and \u201cyoke\u201d as freedom and disciplined strength, reframes the Nativity as a parable of crowded hearts, links liberty to Calvary, argues the church\u2019s distinct spiritual mission, sketches a \u201creligion of the new age\u201d that is practical, unified, and optimistic, explores the kinship of Christianity and American civic ideals, advocates personal evangelism, warns about the church\u2019s tenuous hold on youth, and reads the empty tomb as proof of life\u2019s triumph.

It appears to be a picaresque tale set in the eastern Mediterranean, following a poor but ambitious fisherman whose superstition, pride, and quick wits drive him from his coastal town into a string of risky encounters. Through Sa\u00efd\u2019s brushes with Ottoman soldiers, crafty villagers, a mendicant, and a Christian missionary\u2019s household, the story weighs luck against fate and pokes at human folly with sly humor. Expect vivid local color, moral ambiguity, and an anti-hero propelled as much by vanity as by need.  The opening of the novel shows Sa\u00efd losing the day\u2019s earnings to galloping officers and then discovering his hidden savings stolen after his wife is lured out by a voice mimicking his friend Abdullah\u2019s\u2014who then \u201cadvises\u201d him to flee and opportunistically claims Sa\u00efd\u2019s home and gear. Sa\u00efd and his wife, Hasneh, set out; soldiers confiscate his donkey, he\u2019s struck and humiliated, and on the road he learns from a beggar about a generous Frankish preacher, robs a camel-driver for ransom, and abandons the ailing Hasneh in a village, promising vaguely to send for her. Seeking the missionary\u2019s help, he is chased off by a servant, sneaks back to steal a fine robe and fez, and escapes after the servant falls into a pit; dressed in his new finery, he bluffs his way into deference at a roadside khan. The section closes with Sa\u00efd basking in mistaken status as talk of soldiers and war stirs around him, setting the tone for a journey of gambles, imposture, and shifting fortune.

Set among Silesian weavers in the 1840s, it portrays crushing poverty, factory exploitation, and the mounting pressure toward collective defiance. The drama contrasts the hard-nosed mill owner Dreisziger and his agent Pfeifer with weavers like Baumert, B\u00e4cker, Reimann, Heiber, and Ansorge, along with their families.  The opening of the play unfolds in Dreisziger\u2019s cloth-receiving room, where Pfeifer nitpicks faults, docks pay, and refuses advances as gaunt weavers wait in fear; B\u00e4cker openly defies the boss, a starving child collapses, and Dreisziger delivers a self-justifying lecture before wages are cut further. At the start of the second act, in Ansorge\u2019s squalid hut, the Baumert family weaves in exhaustion, a neighbor despairs of her nine children, and we learn they have even slaughtered their dog for food; ex-soldier J\u00e4ger arrives, drinks, and recites the fierce \u201cVerituomio\u201d verses that inflame their anger. The third act opens in a tavern, where townspeople argue over the weavers\u2019 plight and the truth of official reports; B\u00e4cker and J\u00e4ger enter with a crowd, bruised and singing the seditious song, and despite scoffing by others, the mood among the weavers hardens toward action.

Further pieces defend free verse as an ancient, legitimate form, read music as a mirror of historical spirit, and offer crisp counsel on effective business correspondence. A substantial religious section follows, diagnosing Sabbath decline and modern restlessness, praising \u201clight\u201d as truth and education, reframing Christ\u2019s \u201cyoke\u201d as help rather than burden, urging room for Jesus amid busyness, and linking liberty to sacrifice.

{"77082": "The Russian road to China by Jr. Lindon Bates is a historical travel narrative written in the early 20th century. It traces the overland corridor from European Russia across Siberia and Mongolia to the Chinese frontier, blending on-the-spot travel with a sweeping history of Cossack conquest, caravan trade, and the coming of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The focus is the route\u2019s geography, peoples, and politics\u2014from the Urals and Lake Baikal to Urga, the Great Wall, and Peking. The tone mixes history, reportage, and geopolitical reflection.  The opening of this work first sketches the \u201cpath of the Cossack,\u201d showing how the fur trade, the Stroganovs\u2019 ventures, and Yermak\u2019s campaigns opened Siberia and led to pledging the new realm to Ivan the Terrible, then follows the push east to Yakutsk and the Pacific, the treaties that closed and reopened trade, and the great tea caravans through Kiahta and Urga. It argues that railways and war shifted Russia\u2019s access to China, with the Manchurian route crippled after conflict and the old Mongolian road holding future promise. Bates paints vivid scenes of Cossacks, settlers, Old Believers, Buriats, and Mongol lamas, and the stark contrasts of empire and steppe. The narrative then shifts aboard the Trans-Siberian: a wintry climb over the Urals, life in the dining car, a former political convict\u2019s seven-year march, the vast monotony of the steppe, and stops that prompt tales of Omsk\u2019s river web, Tomsk\u2019s missed railway link, the great railway strike, exile to the Yakutsk, and the Crown\u2019s \u201ccabinetski\u201d domains.

Set in Palma during the panic of the yellow fever scare of the early 1870s, it lampoons rumor, fear, and official overreaction.

{"77090": "The pedigree of fascism : A popular essay on the Western philosophy of\u2026 by Aline Lion is a political-philosophical essay written in the early 20th century. It examines Italian Fascism as both a national outgrowth and a universal doctrine, setting it against the political history of post-unification Italy and the broader currents of European thought. The work aims to clarify for general readers what Fascism claims to be, how it arose, and why its philosophy should not simply be exported, while situating its roots from the Risorgimento and World War I to an intellectual lineage running from the Renaissance to Croce and Gentile.  The opening of the book asks whether Fascism is a revolution and answers by defining it as a new, immanent relation between State and citizen that rejects \u201cnatural rights,\u201d binds rights to duties, and treats citizenship as a moral-spiritual practice. It contrasts universal ideas with their local, historical \u201cform,\u201d likens this to the French Revolution, and then surveys Italy\u2019s political path: an elite-led Risorgimento that unified the state but ignored social and economic realities; a Liberalism that imported foreign models, mishandled Church-state tensions, and lacked party discipline; Socialism that awakened workers yet tilted toward materialist aims and coercive tactics; and Nationalism that was lofty but too external and statist. The narrative moves through Italy\u2019s hesitant neutrality and irredentist push into World War I, arguing that the war (especially after Caporetto) forged a genuine national conscience, turning subjects into citizens\u2014the true culmination of the Risorgimento\u2014only for postwar disillusion, factory seizures, and Fiume to expose a hollow state. It concludes this opening movement by presenting Fascism as a practical, anti-ideological method that synthesizes class interests through duty-bound citizenship and order, then pivots to its philosophical pedigree, introducing Fascism\u2019s aim-centered method, Gentile\u2019s idea of liberty as the identification of wills (illustrated by a team captain), and the early modern roots of competing \u201crealities\u201d (Bruno\u2019s historical, Bacon\u2019s empirical, Descartes\u2019 rational).

{"77091": "\"Problems of the Libyan Desert\" by John Ball is a scientific publication written in the early 20th century. It synthesizes exploration, surveying, and geology to explain the Libyan Desert\u2019s great depressions, artesian waters, dunes, and rumored \u201clost\u201d oases, while evaluating whether basins like Qattara and Wadi Rayan could be harnessed for irrigation, drainage, or power. The work also challenges persistent myths\u2014most notably that a former Nile branch crossed the western desert\u2014by using new contour mapping and hydrological reasoning.  The opening of the work lays out a dozen central questions about the region and explains how recent triangulation and improved barometric leveling enabled a first, provisional contoured map. It lists a chain of sub\u2011sea\u2011level basins culminating in the vast, newly confirmed Qattara Depression, outlines the major escarpments and highlands (Gilf Kebir, Oweinat, Kissu), and uses these data to dismiss the old \u201cdry river\u201d idea of a Nile branch to the Mediterranean. The author attributes the depressions chiefly to wind erosion acting on soft strata breached through structural weaknesses, illustrating a subtle deepening mechanism observed in coastal \u201cbosom\u201d basins, and then weighs engineering schemes: Wadi Rayan as a sump looks plausible, while a Qattara sea and hydropower face prohibitive topography and cost. He traces the artesian system to the Erdi\u2013Ennedi highlands, derives static water\u2011level contours from wells and lakes, explains the persistence of desert lakes via underground inflow, and notes the Nile\u2019s capture of warm artesian water near Dakka. From these contours he rejects deep coastal artesian wells, warns that well interference and external drains may lower oasis heads, and begins to test traditions about \u201cZerzura\u201d against the new topographic and hydrologic evidence.

The book contemplates love, loss, spiritual yearning, and the artist\u2019s vocation, using luminous natural imagery and intimate, introspective voices to explore how pain is transmuted into beauty.  The collection opens with a self-portrait of inspiration\u2014a poised soul and a heart made a \u201csilver pool\u201d\u2014then moves through scenes of marketplaces and carnivals, wanderers and lovers, sea winds and desert tents, to weigh the worth of authenticity against show and fame\u2019s mirage. Voices speak from exile and devotion, from a courtesan longing for the desert\u2019s purity, from a rebel marked by tropical splendor and peril, and from the wayfarer who hears only wind, stars, and dawn. Recurring motifs\u2014fire and water, moon and dawn, glass and jewels, gardens and home\u2014frame meditations on fate, identity, and faith: grief is burned to ash and found again as a hidden gem; love stands as watch-fire and sacrament; death is challenged by continuity in nature and song. Tender addresses to a father, to June, and to a child promise to turn scars into pearls and broken songs into a bright strand, closing the book on resilience, reverence, and hard-won peace.

{"77095": "\"The history and adventures of the renowned Don Quixote\" by Cervantes Saavedra is a novel written in the early 17th century. It satirizes the fad for chivalric romances through the misadventures of an aging La Mancha hidalgo who remakes himself as a knight-errant, with his earthy squire Sancho Panza in tow. Comic and compassionate, it explores the tension between idealism and reality as its hero reads the world through the fantasies he adores.  The opening of the book includes a substantial biographical sketch praising the author\u2019s courage and ingenuity through hardship, a translator\u2019s note pledging to preserve the work\u2019s humor and tone, and a playful preface in which a friend advises the writer to fabricate scholarly trappings. The story then begins with a frugal country gentleman who reads so many tales of knighthood that he loses his wits, refurbishes ancestral armor, fashions a pasteboard visor, names his horse Rozinante, himself Don Quixote de La Mancha, and his imagined lady Dulcinea del Toboso. He sets out unknighted, trusting he\u2019ll be dubbed later, and promptly mistakes an inn for a castle, two prostitutes for noble ladies, and a landlord for a castellan; the scene closes with the women trying to remove his armor while his helmet is hopelessly fastened.

{"77096": "\"Comment s''en vont les reines\" by Colette Yver is a novel written in the early 20th century. Set in a small northern monarchy where republican fervor rises against the crown, it follows the new delegate Samuel Wartz and his spirited wife Madeleine as courtly spectacle, parliamentary strategy, and private loyalties entwine. The narrative explores how prestige, propaganda, and personal feeling shape public life, with special attention to the quiet burdens carried by politicians\u2019 wives. Its central tension lies in the waning power of monarchy and the calculated making of a modern republic.  The opening of the novel centers on a royal ball at Oldsburg\u2019s city hall, where the young republican Wartz, dazzled yet wary, encounters Queen B\u00e9atrix\u2019s charm offensive while Madeleine, radiant, draws notice\u2014even from a royal prince. Amid the glitter, Wartz\u2019s circle debates his signature plan for compulsory education and the tactics needed to turn it into a transformative political lever. A private scene on a deserted staircase reveals Madeleine\u2019s secret \u201cpolitics of the heart\u201d: her long, unspoken bond with their mentor, Dr. Saltzen, which fuels Wartz\u2019s insecurity. Soon after, the dubious fixer Bertrand Auburger approaches Wartz, then proves his worth by exposing a rival\u2019s attempt to preempt the education law\u2014forcing Wartz into the murky \u201cunderneath\u201d of politics; the sequence closes with Saltzen\u2019s poignant critique, sparked by the melancholy of their servant Hannah, that mass schooling may awaken new pains in a people not yet given the strength to bear them.

{"77100": "The handsome Brandons by Katharine Tynan is a novel written in the early 20th century. Set in rural Ireland, it follows the proud but impoverished Brandon family\u2014narrated by Hilda, the self-described \u201cugly duckling\u201d\u2014as they struggle to hold their ancestral home against the ruthless Sir Rupert De Lacy of Castle Angry. With Aline\u2019s steadfast leadership, brother Pierce\u2019s far-off wanderings, and the lives of siblings Esther, Hugh, Donald, and the twins, the story blends family fortunes, romance, and superstition against a vividly drawn landscape.  The opening of the novel contrasts sunny Brandon Mountain with brooding Angry Mountain and sketches the long feud between the Brandons and the De Lacys, rooted in Sir Rupert\u2019s trick that cost the Brandons a copper seam and their prosperity. Hilda recounts their genteel poverty in the decaying house, Aline\u2019s quiet heroism, and Pierce\u2019s departure with the famed explorer Mr. Desmond\u2014followed by a mysterious quarrel and silence. A reckless day at Annagassan Races leaves Hilda badly injured when a borrowed car bolts; a kind young officer helps her, and Aline pays for her care by selling a treasured diamond collet.

{"77101": "\"The Gaelic State in the Past & Future; or, ''The Crown of a Nation''\" by Darrell Figgis is a historical-political treatise written in the early 20th century. It argues that Ireland\u2019s statehood should be rebuilt from its own historic polity\u2014rooted in Brehon law, landholding tuatha, and functional assemblies\u2014rather than borrowed from imperial or colonial models. Blending analysis and prescription, it reconstructs the workings of the old Gaelic State and outlines how its principles could be modernized into a sovereign, democratic framework.  The opening of the work defines a \u201ccrowned\u201d nation as one that expresses its spirit through its own State, then contends that Ireland once possessed such sovereignty and must rediscover it by studying its own history. Figgis traces the emergence of a centralized Gaelic polity from Tuathal and Cormac through Tara\u2019s assemblies, the codification of law, and the layered organization of tuatha, brehons, elected kings, and public hospitallers, with land held corporately by the people. He explains how this system functioned, its social equity (including women\u2019s legal standing), and its weaknesses\u2014dynastic succession, disruptive provincial power, and the absence of a national army\u2014which the Norman conquest froze before they could be resolved. He then surveys the broken state: invasion, partial Gaelicization of Norman lords, the Statutes of Kilkenny, Tudor reconquest, Hugh O\u2019Neill\u2019s bid to preserve the tuatha, Cromwellian dispossession, and the people\u2019s quiet return to their lands beneath a landlord layer. The nineteenth-century \u201cresurrection\u201d follows: Emancipation, the Land War\u2019s reassertion of the freeman\u2019s right (including boycotting as a revival of communal sanction), cultural revival via the Gaelic League, and co\u2011operative societies as modern echoes of stateships. Finally, he turns to the future: discard English administrative molds, complete land purchase, and build a modern Irish State with a representative assembly anchored by specialized national councils (for farming, labour, law, education, defence) and a balancing senate\u2014thus translating the old Gaelic polity into contemporary form.

{"77103": "\"The works of the Rev. Isaac Watts, D. D. in nine volumes (volume 1 of 9)\" by Watts is a collection of sermons and theological writings written in the early 18th century. This volume combines a memoir of Isaac Watts with a pastoral dedication, a practical preface, and forty-three sermons that teach core Christian doctrines and everyday piety. It emphasizes the inward witness of faith, Christian morality, the atonement of Christ, and the right use of life and death, aiming to guide believers in clear, devotional, and useful religion.  The opening of this volume presents a contents list followed by a substantial memoir that traces Watts\u2019s life, character, and ministry: his early brilliance and nonconformist convictions, rigorous studies, pastoral leadership in London, seasons of debilitating illness, long residence with Sir Thomas Abney, charitable spirit, lucid and fervent preaching, wide-ranging publications (from hymns to logic and The Improvement of the Mind), ecumenical friendships, and serene, confident death. A heartfelt dedication to his Berry-street congregation explains that, constrained by ill health, he offers printed sermons to serve them from his retirement. The preface sets his aim to make doctrine plain, practical, and suitable for family reading, favoring heart-changing instruction over speculative display. At the start of Sermon I (\u201cThe Inward Witness to Christianity\u201d), he argues that believers possess an internal testimony to the truth of the gospel (1 John 5:10), urging readers to ground their faith on solid evidence before examining their personal interest in its promises.

{"77104": "The red terror in Russia by S. P. Mel\u02b9gunov is a historical account written in the early 20th century. It examines how the Bolshevik state built and justified a machinery of repression\u2014above all the Cheka\u2014through hostages, mass executions, and ideological calls for \u201cRed Terror.\u201d Drawing on decrees, press appeals, eyewitness testimony, and case material from across Russia and Ukraine, the study argues that terror was a deliberate policy rather than a spontaneous outburst of popular rage.  The opening of the book presents a translator\u2019s note and a brief portrait of the author as a historian-activist persecuted by the Soviet regime, then moves to an introduction in which the narrator rejects individual terrorism after a caf\u00e9 interlocutor asks why no one kills Bolshevik leaders\u2014arguing that such acts would only trigger mass reprisals against hostages. Chapter I details how, following early attacks on Bolshevik officials, the state institutionalized hostage-taking and retaliatory shootings, vividly depicting nights of fear in Moscow\u2019s Butyrka prison and similar reprisals across the provinces, including women and children among the victims; even Peter Kropotkin\u2019s protest against hostage policy is cited. Chapter II challenges the official claim that terror was \u201cforced\u201d by enemies, tracing the swift restoration of the death penalty, summary orders to shoot, and press exhortations to \u201canswer blood with blood,\u201d culminating in Petrovsky\u2019s directive to employ mass terror and the rise of a nationwide Cheka network that eclipsed the soviets. The beginning of Chapter III defines the Cheka as an organ for destroying enemies rather than judging them, quotes Latzis\u2019s class-based test for guilt, and disputes official statistics by pointing to underreported massacres and crackdowns on strikes and revolts from Kiev and Odessa to Astrakhan and Turkestan.

{"77105": "\"Chronicles of the house of Borgia\" by Frederick Rolfe is a historical account written in the early 20th century. It reassesses the Borgia dynasty within the tumultuous world of the Italian Renaissance and papal power, challenging lurid legends and arguing from close scrutiny of sources as it traces the family\u2019s rise from Spain to Rome, especially under Popes Calixtus III and Alexander VI.  The opening of the book sets out Rolfe\u2019s stance: great houses rise and fall swiftly, the Borgias have been used as a canvas for exaggeration, and many chroniclers are biased, so the narrative will weigh testimony and strip away calumny. The story then begins in 1455, amid the shock of Constantinople\u2019s fall and the influx of Greek learning into Italy, contrasting Nicholas V\u2019s cultural flowering with Rome\u2019s alarm at the Turkish threat. Rolfe details the conclave after Nicholas\u2019s death: factions led by Colonna and Orsini, the near-choice of Bessarion, and the compromise election of the Spanish canonist Alonso de Borja as Calixtus III. A concise genealogy introduces the Borja roots in Valencia, explains contemporary norms about legitimacy, and sketches Alonso\u2019s service to King Alfonso of Aragon and his diplomatic skill in ending schisms. The narrative dramatizes Calixtus\u2019s coronation and the Orsini-led riot at the Lateran, then portrays him as austere, legally minded, and focused on a crusade rather than arts\u2014refuting the tale that he dispersed the Vatican library and illustrating his patronage through the Lorenzo Valla episode. It closes with his firm handling of Emperor Frederick\u2019s envoys and his public vow to wage relentless war against the Turks. (This is an automatically generated summary.)"}

The story follows Kustaa Saarenp\u00e4\u00e4, a driven rural sawmill owner whose bold speculation and debts threaten his business and marriage to the sharp-tongued Katri. Local powerholder Kallio\u2014and Kustaa\u2019s former love Johanna\u2014complicate matters as money, pride, and community standing collide. It\u2019s a tense, character-led drama about ambition, debt, and betrayal on the edges of Finland\u2019s timber economy.  The opening of the play presents Kustaa on the brink of losing his sawmill at a forced auction, hounded by creditors and scorned by his wife, until Kallio unexpectedly buys the mill and promises to let Kustaa run it back, allegedly at Johanna\u2019s urging. Brief relief turns to unease when Kallio fails to formalize the deal; Mykkyr\u00e4, a ruined neighbor, warns that Kallio is not to be trusted, and creditor Hakala presses for repayment. In Act II Johanna secretly visits to warn Kustaa that Kallio has likely flipped the mill to city timber men for a higher profit, shattering Kustaa\u2019s hopes and igniting Katri\u2019s fury. Act III begins with Kustaa desolate while Mykkyr\u00e4 offers grim consolation and confirms the rumor, underscoring the play\u2019s early arc from fragile hope to betrayal.

{"77107": "\"Onnen unelma :  Romaani\" by Martti Wuori is a novel written in the early 20th century. It centers on middle\u2011aged playwright Ensio Arola and Leeni Saares, a talented young factory worker who dreams of the stage, as their lives intersect in Helsinki\u2019s working\u2011class Hermanni. The story explores artistic ambition, class tensions, religious strictness at home, and the awakening of late-blooming feeling.  The opening of the novel follows Arola to a workers\u2019 theatre rehearsal of his play, where he meets actress Martta Hinnermo and is captivated by Leeni, who is cast in the lead. Friction flares with Leeni\u2019s unpleasant partner H\u00e4rm\u00e4l\u00e4, a jealous fianc\u00e9, leading to a public quarrel that breaks their engagement and collapses the rehearsal. Arola returns home stirred by new emotion and reflects on his past: orphanhood, studies abroad, a destructive affair in Vienna, an unhappy marriage and divorce, and his life as a writer. The narrative then turns to Leeni\u2019s cramped home: a sympathetic, dignified mother and a stern, religious stepfather opposed to her stage ambitions; H\u00e4rm\u00e4l\u00e4 barges in with accusations about a gentleman friend, prompting Leeni to assert her independence and plan to leave home. At the start of the next day, Arola, unable to write, finds himself drawn toward Leeni\u2019s neighborhood, and the scene breaks as a bright spring Sunday fills Kaisaniemi.

{"77108": "\"Occultists & mystics of all ages\" by Ralph Shirley is a collection of biographical essays written in the early 20th century. It examines the lives, legends, and philosophies of notable figures associated with occultism and mysticism, weighing primary sources against later myth and religious polemic to distinguish history from fable. The volume ranges from Apollonius of Tyana and Plotinus to Michael Scot, Paracelsus, Emanuel Swedenborg, Count Cagliostro, and Anna Kingsford.  The opening of this volume lists its seven subjects and then launches into extended portraits. First comes Apollonius of Tyana, where the author sifts Philostratus and Damis against Christian polemics (Hierocles versus Eusebius), recounting emblematic episodes\u2014reviving a Roman bride, foreknowing imperial events, and advising emperors\u2014while stressing his Pythagorean asceticism, travels (including India), and teaching on reincarnation. Next, Plotinus is set in the Alexandrian milieu, his life (Ammonius Saccas, Rome, Porphyry\u2019s editing) sketched before a clear outline of Neoplatonism: the One, Intellect, and Soul; matter as privation; the universe as a living, sympathetic organism; mystical union; and the perennial puzzles of evil, time, and creation. The section on Michael Scot intertwines border-ballad legend (Melrose Abbey\u2019s \u201cBook of Might\u201d) with history\u2014his Toledo translations of Arab science, colorful alchemical and hypnotic feats, service to Frederick II, medical reforms, frustrated church preferment, and death lore\u2014and the next chapter opens by framing Paracelsus as a defiant reformer against entrenched orthodoxy.

{"77109": "\"A journey to the world under-ground\" by Ludvig Holberg is a satirical travel narrative written in the mid-18th century. It follows the Norwegian student Nicholas Klim, who tumbles into a hollow-earth cosmos and lands on the planet Nazar, a society of reasoning, walking trees. Through his misadventures, the work lampoons politics, law, religion, scholarship, and social pretensions in the manner of a philosophical voyage. Readers who enjoy inventive world-building with Swift-like bite will find this a sharp, witty exploration of alternative civility.  The opening of the narrative shows Klim, newly returned to Bergen and short on means, exploring a famed mountain cave; when his rope snaps he plunges into an inner firmament, duels a griffin in midair, and lands on Nazar. Mistaken for a bizarre animal\u2014and even for a would-be assailant of a magistrate\u2019s \u201cwife\u201d (a tree)\u2014he is seized, tried with solemn ritual, and subjected to \u201cvenae-section,\u201d then taught the language and examined by state assessors. In Keba he observes sober customs: disputations turned into stage sport, restrained funerals, high honor for husbandmen, and confinement for metaphysical hair-splitters; sent to the capital Potu, he witnesses harsh risk for legal \u201cprojectors,\u201d meets a mild but firm prince, and is judged quick but shallow\u2014therefore appointed royal messenger. As he begins his service, the book sketches the empire\u2019s orderly features: a single language, ingenious machinery, incentives for large families, strict one-office rules, no inherited nobility, and a noncoercive civic religion that forbids speculative theology and treats victory in war with silence rather than triumph.

{"77110": "\"... Et l''horreur des responsabilit\u00e9s (suite au Culte de l''incomp\u00e9tence)\" by Faguet is a political and legal essay written in the early 20th century. It contends that modern French institutions are consciously arranged to evade responsibility, with special emphasis on how the judiciary and public life shift blame onto laws, superiors, and the state. The work continues the author\u2019s broader critique of civic incompetence by examining law, professions, family, and social customs through a sharp, polemical lens.  The opening of the treatise argues that the French strive to be irresponsible and first targets legal ideas and customs. It claims that, since the Revolution, judges are reduced to automatic applicators of statutes, shedding moral responsibility, unlike the old French magistrates, English judges, or Roman praetors who shaped law and felt its burdens. Beccaria\u2019s case for strict textualism is invoked to show how fear of \u201cthe spirit of the law\u201d also shelters judges from blame. The author defends the Ancien R\u00e9gime\u2019s sale of judicial offices (following Montesquieu and La Beaumelle against Voltaire) as a paradoxical guarantee of independence, and argues the Revolution annexed justice to the executive, making government the true judge. He then illustrates politicized judging: the Paris court\u2019s condemnation of Cardinal Lu\u00e7on, allegedly based on ministry assurances and a distorted quotation, and the 1906 Court of Cassation in the Dreyfus affair, said to have inverted a legal article to avoid a new court-martial\u2014thus appeasing power while keeping the case unresolved. The narrative widens to show executive and parliamentary encroachment, the sway of deputies and local \u201cgovernments,\u201d and echoes of Guizot and Poincar\u00e9 on the danger of politics in the courts. In sum, the beginning portrays a judiciary doubly shielded\u2014by literalism and by obedience\u2014leaving justice in the hands of an irresponsible authority.

{"77111": "\"The Mother\" by Grazia Deledda is a novel written in the early 20th century. Set in a remote Sardinian village, it is a stark psychological study of a young priest, Paul, his devoted mother Maria Maddalena, and Agnes, the solitary woman who awakens his forbidden desire. The story probes the clash between human love and religious duty, filtered through superstition, village poverty, and maternal anguish. Its tension is intimate and fateful, unfolding over a brief span with the inevitability of tragedy.  The opening of the novel follows a stormy night in which Maria Maddalena realizes Paul is slipping out to a woman\u2019s house and, after failing to intervene, returns home torn between fear, faith, and a vivid, unsettling dream of the parish\u2019s disgraced former priest. Paul, having just agreed to flee with Agnes, is shaken by the wind and his conscience, prays at the church door, then faces his mother; pressed by her quiet firmness, he swears to end the affair. Through a sleepless, tormented night he oscillates between resolve and longing, finally writing a letter to break it off; at dawn he celebrates Mass, chastens his meager flock, and has his mother deliver the note before being summoned to a dying hunter. Interwoven are memories that deepen the stakes: the mother\u2019s recollection of their hopeful arrival in Aar and Paul\u2019s of childhood shame at his mother\u2019s servitude, seminary years, and an earlier encounter with a fallen woman. The section closes with domestic unease, the sacristan boy\u2019s brisk chatter, and a pointed exchange about priestly celibacy, underscoring the moral conflict now set in motion.

{"77112": "Les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires by \u00c9mile Faguet is a philosophical treatise written in the early 20th century. It examines how societies are built and held together by \u201cnecessary prejudices\u201d\u2014beliefs people adopt less from proof than from social need. Arguing that humans are naturally familial and only reluctantly social, it claims war both creates and sustains society, forging civic cohesion and recasting instincts. The work appears set to analyze core beliefs (such as love of life and free will) as instruments that align individuals with collective survival.  The opening of this treatise questions whether humans are innately social, comparing us with solitary, social, and gregarious animals and concluding we most resemble the gregarious. It traces a path from prolonged childrearing to family, sedentarism, domestication, and agriculture, then argues that true society arose not from the family but from war driven by population pressure, which necessitated defensive coalitions, laws, and permanent states that elevate martial virtues. Faguet then defines \u201cnecessary prejudices\u201d and illustrates two: love of life, which society redirects from personal impulse to patriotic self-sacrifice, and free will, treated as a probable illusion yet a socially imposed creed that grounds responsibility, punishment, remorse, and conversion. The section closes by canvassing critiques of volition (Spinoza, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Ribot) while explaining why belief in freedom persists because society requires it.

{"77113": "\"The autobiography of Sir Henry Morton Stanley, G.C.B.\" by Henry M. Stanley is an autobiography written in the early 20th century. It presents Stanley\u2019s own account of his rise from a neglected, workhouse childhood to global renown as an African explorer and public figure, with the narrative completed and arranged from his journals and letters by his wife, Dorothy. Readers should expect a frank portrait of hardship, ambition, faith, and endurance leading into the major expeditions that reshaped European knowledge of Central Africa.  The opening of this autobiography begins with a laudatory foreword and an editor\u2019s preface explaining that Stanley left the work unfinished and that the narrative is supplemented from his diaries, letters, and lectures; it also notes the criticism he faced, his lack of personal enrichment from Africa, and his frustrations with British policy. Stanley\u2019s own introduction declares his resolve to tell the unvarnished truth of his inner life. He then recounts his earliest memories in Denbigh, the death of his grandfather, and his removal to the St. Asaph Union Workhouse, where a brutal schoolmaster imposed constant violence. He describes the terror and discipline of that world, the death of a schoolmate, his intense turn to religion for comfort, passing recognition for drawing and study, and a brief, chilling encounter with his mother. A collective punishment over a damaged table leads him to refuse a flogging, fight back, and flee the institution with a friend. The section closes with the boys\u2019 first days on the run\u2014hiding in a lime-kiln, begging food from a kindly woman, and edging back toward Denbigh in fear and hope.

{"77114": "\"Noin suuri :  Romaani\" by Edna Ferber is a novel written in the early 20th century. Set in and around Chicago\u2019s Dutch truck-farming community, it centers on Selina Peake DeJong, a spirited young woman who becomes a rural schoolteacher and raises her son, Dirk (\u201cNoin Suuri\u201d). The story probes the tension between beauty and utility, and between humane values and material success, against a backdrop of immigrant farm life and urban ambition.  The opening of the novel follows Selina\u2019s son\u2019s teasing nickname, \u201cNoin suuri,\u201d then pivots to Selina\u2019s past: her itinerant childhood with a charming gambler father, her bookish imagination, and her happy school years in Chicago. When her father is killed in a gambling hall, she is left with two diamonds and a small sum, chooses independence over returning to austere relatives, and secures a teaching post in High Prairie through family friends. She sells one diamond, outfits herself sensibly, and rides out with Klaas Pool to the Dutch farming settlement, marveling at the cabbages and fields as if they were jewels and tapestries. At the Pool farm she meets the hard-working Maartje and daughters Geertje and Jozina, learns that twelve-year-old Roelf labors instead of schooling, and encounters the chilly, spotless household with its Dutch heirlooms and strict routines. The tone mixes Selina\u2019s romantic eye for beauty with the plain, practical world she is entering, setting up her resilience and curiosity as she begins her new life.

{"77115": "\"An ice cream laboratory guide by W. W. Fisk and H. B. Ellenberger\" is a scientific laboratory manual from the early 20th century. It introduces the principles and practice of ice cream manufacture, aiming to teach consistent quality through standardized methods, controlled processing, and systematic evaluation.  The book outlines essential equipment and safety, then moves through step\u2011by\u2011step laboratory exercises that cover standardizing mixes (using Pearson\u2019s rectangular method), testing fat by modified Babcock procedures, and managing salt\u2013ice temperatures. It classifies products\u2014plain/Philadelphia (vanilla, chocolate, fruit, nut, bisque), cooked/French (parfaits, custards, puddings), sherbets and ices (water and milk sherbets, punches, lacto), and mousse\u2014providing working formulas and directions. It explains stabilizers (gelatin, powders, gum tragacanth) and their preparation; details freezing technique, measuring and improving \u201cswell,\u201d and proper hardening (salt\u2011ice and cold\u2011room methods); and shows how to make bricks and moulded novelties. Advanced experiments test how fat level, binders, milk solids\u2011not\u2011fat, pasteurization, emulsification, homogenization, cream aging, mix temperature, and freezing time affect texture, overrun, and flavor. Quality control includes score cards for judging, bacterial counts, and gelatin testing, with final assignments for plant visits and student\u2011devised receipts.
